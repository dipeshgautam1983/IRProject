Course Overview : This course is designed to present strategic management from the point of view of the practicing general manager. It focuses on specific knowledge and skills that are required to understand strategy and the process by which it is developed in business organizations, and provides information on the situation and context in which strategy is formed and implemented. The course will integrate knowledge and skills developed in the core courses of the E MBA program, but that is not its only goal. Specific new information about the activities and skills of general managers will be presented. Students are expected to combin e knowledge from other courses with information presented here to develop sophisticated interpretations and analyses of actual business problems and opportunities. The course contains a substantial writing component. Students will prepare written business case analyses on both an individual basis and a group basis, and business case presentations on a group basis. The expected level of quality and professionalism of the content and presentation of these cases will be that used in actual business organizati ons. Much managerial communication is verbal. Therefore, class discussion of lecture and case materials forms a substantial portion of the grade for this course. The principal objective of the course is for students to learn important facts and procedure s about the strategic management process, while developing an understanding that strategy (and the jobs of those who formulate and implement strategy) is a highly uncertain activity in which only careful thought, sensitivity to the managerial environment, and creativity will succeed in the long run. Course Learning Objectives: 1. Development and reinforcement of a general management point of view the capacity to view the firm from an overall perspective in the context of its environment. 2. Development of an understanding of fundamental concepts in strategic management: the role of the general manager; the levels and components of strategy; competitive analysis; the industrial organization perspective; the resource - based view of the firm; and organizationa l evolution. 3. Understanding of the influence of global competition on firm strategy and performance. 4. Detailed analysis and discussion of important social and ethical issues faced by managers. 5. Synthesis of the knowledge gained in previous courses an d understanding what part of that knowledge is useful to general managers. 6. Development of an awareness of the impact of the economic, social, demographic, technological, and l on business and corporate strategy. 7. Practice in working out business strategies and implementation plans. 8. Development of habits for orderly, analytical thinking and skill in reporting conclusions effectively in both written and oral form. 9. Familiarity with some of the practical realities of running different types of businesses. Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree This writing - intensive course is designed to help you to meet the overall learning goals for the MBA degree offered by the Fogelman College. You should take the time to become familiar with the overall learning goals as a student in your particular MBA program: MBA omes.pdf EMBA greeLearningOutcomes.pdf IMBA gOutcomes/EMBADegreeLearningOutcomes.pdf Grading and Evaluation Criteria Performance evaluation will be based on student performance in six activities: class participation, midterm exam, individual case analysis, team cas e analysis, team presentation , and homework. Final Course Grades Final course grades are earned according to the following table: Point Range Assigned Grade 90 - 100 Points A 80 - 89 Points B 70 - 79 Points C 60 - 69 Points D Under 60 Points F Performance evaluation will be based on student performance in six activities: class participation, midterm exam, individual case analysis, team case analysis, team presentation, and homework. A detailed description of each of the assessed activities can b e found after the scoring summary table below. Summary of Graded Activities Points earned on the assessed activities will be distributed as follows: Deliverable Total Points Case Participation 20 Homework 10 Midterm Examination 10 Individual Case Paper 30 Team Case Paper 20 Team Presentation 10 Total 100 pts Case Participation -- 2 0 % of the grade Attendance ( on time ) is required and is a component of the participation grade. In a typical class, one or more students will be asked to start the class by answering a specific question or discussing a specific issue. A thoughtful reading of the chapter or case assigned for that class meeting should be sufficient to handle these leadoff discussions. As a group, we will then discuss the s assignment to develop a fuller understanding of the issues presented. Voluntary participation in discussion of case issues is an important part of this process and an important part of your class participation grade. Please raise your hand to obtain reco gnition before speaking. - class contribution to the discussion. The bases for this assessment include the following: 1. Are the points made relevant to the discussion? A re they linked to the comments of others? 2. Do the comments add to our understanding of the lecture or case discussion? 3. Do the comments show careful reading and understanding of the text and/or case? 4. Does the participant distinguish among different kinds of data (that is facts, opinions, beliefs, concepts, etc?) or Homework -- 10% of the grade ten out of the eleven class meetings between August 2 7 and November 21 (not counting the midterm) . The content of the daily homework assignment will vary depending on the class content for the day it is due. 1. On days when book chapter s or a book is to be discussed, then the assignment is to either (a) include a brief set of two or three original thought - provoking discussion questions (no more than six sentences total) about each chapter or (b) to provide an example (either positive or negative) of a company and situation currently in the news that illustrates one or more of the concepts in the ch apter with a brief summary of the situation and how the concepts from the chapter are confirmed or denied (include a copy of or link to an article from a business publication or website if possible). 2. On days when a case is to be discussed, then the assignm ent is to provide a brief statement (again, no more than six sentences total) about what you think the company in the case study should do, and why. If you are writing up the case for that day, you should briefly summarize your recommendations. 3. On most day s, when both case s and chapter s are to be discussed, then the assignment is to do both of the above. 4. Homework needs to cover all assignments for that class. Each assignment omitted will reduce the homework grade by one full letter grade. The dropboxes on elearn will close at the beginning of each class . emphasized in the descriptions above. These assignments should be able to be completed in at most 10 to 15 minutes. Each homework represents 1 % of your final grade. If you turn in more than 10 homeworks, you will get extra credit (added to your homework grade, not your overall course grade) . Midterm Examination -- 10 % of the grade A midterm examination consisting of multiple choice, true/false, and short essay questions will cover the material in the strategy formulation portion of the textbook (Wheelen & Hunger chapters 1 - 8), 4 Arena Hypercompetition, and any related material covered in class . Students - level strategies, corporate - level strategies, diversification strategies, and all other relevant material. Individual Case Analysis -- 3 0 % of the grade After the first two class meeting s , you will be expected to choose one case study for your individual case analysis report. A preference sheet for the case analysis reports is attached, and you will be expected turn it in by the third class meeting. When the preference sheets have been tur ned in, I will assign the cases based on your preferences and distribute copies to all students in the course. You might want to coordinate your choices with your team members, as only one member of a team can be assigned a specific case. The individual ca se analysis report constitutes 3 0 % of your overall course grade. This is a very substantial assignment, and will take man y, man y hours of preparation. It cannot be done in one night, or even in one weekend. The individual case analysis report consists of t wo parts, a strategic audit (attached as an appendix) as described in the textbook and as amended by in - class lectures , and an executive summary. The executive summary should be around seven to ten pages of double - spaced text, with charts and figures inclu ded where appropriate. Brevity is important. Your individual case analysis report due dates are on the dropboxes on elearn. Be ready to be a major participant in the case discussion. Be ready to be a major participant in the case discussion. You will not b e graded separately on the discussion, although it will count as part of your class participation grade. While in - class discussions will be addressing the case as writ ten ( as of the time of the case ) , when you analyze and write up your case you are required to do dynamic case analysis ( as the teams will also be required to do ) and address the current problems facing the company . See General Requirements for Case Analyses and Dynamic Case Analysis in the next section. Team Case Analysis -- 20% of the grade Each team will, in consultation with the instructor, select a real - world , publicly - traded , company to analyze. Do not begin work until you have written approval (via email). The written team case analysis reports constitutes 20% of your overall course grade. I expect a much higher quality of writing from the team cases. The teams are also required to do a dynamic case analysis as explained in the next section. The companies m ust be studied as of today . The team case analysis reports should include a complete strategic audit, as described in the textbook and as amended by in - class lectures , as well as an executive summary (seven to ten pages of double - spaced text), with charts and figures included where appropriate. But again, brevity is important . Peer Evaluation Each team member will fill out the Peer Evaluation Form attached to this syllabus and put it in a sealed envelope and turn it in with the team case analysis. These peer evaluations will be used to adjust the grade on this assignment upwards for team members who made a larger contribution and downwards for team members who made a lesser contribution, as perceived by their teammates. If you do not turn in a Peer Evalua tion, the instructor may take up to 10 points from your grade and reallocate it amongst your team as he sees fit. For example, suppose that the team receives an A - /B+ (90 points out of 100) on their team case analysis , and the peer - evaluations were as foll ows (read the first column as: Member A gives 30 points each to peers B,C, and D, and 10 points to E, for a total of 100 points) Points assigned by Member A Member B Member C Member D Member E Total Score Points Assigned To Member A 30 30 20 25 105 Member B 30 20 30 25 105 Member C 30 20 30 25 105 Member D 30 20 20 25 95 Member E 10 30 30 20 90 Total 100 100 100 100 100 500 In the above case, Members A, B, a nd C would each receive 1.05 X 9 0, or 94 .5 points (an A) , Member D would receive 0.95 X 9 0, or 85 .5 points (a B) , an d Member E would receive 0.9 X 9 0, or 81 points (a B - ), keeping the group average at 9 0 points. Team Case Presentation -- 1 0% of the grade In addition to the written case analysis, each team will prepare a brief ( 15 to 25 minute) forma l presentation of their analyses and recommendations . Be aware that everyone in the class (including the professor and any guests) will be free to ask questions following your presentation. Your handling of quest ions will be part of the grade for the presentation. Y ou will present your analysis and recommendations for solving the current major problem or issue facing the company. As in the real world, you are responsible for being completely current. If late - break ing news affects your problem or recommendations, you need to incorporate it into your presentation. Each team member must participate in the formal presentation. Your presentation should be in PowerPoint form, and presented using the classroom computer fa cilities. You should also be prepared with backup transparencies in case there are problems with the computer or the projection system. You should also be prepared to continue your presentation if the overhead projector also fails. The group presentation c onstitutes 1 0% of your overall course grade. The content of the presentation will be one - fourth (25%) of the grade. The quality of the presentation will be one - fourth (25%) of the grade. Your individual presentation style will be one - half (50%) of the grad e. General Requirements for Case Analyses Approach the assignment as though you are a management consultant hired by the management of the company in the case to solve their problem. First, you must determine what the problem is. Then recommend an action plan for the company to follow. The case analysis report is your formal report to time repeating them. Also, since this report is to execut ives, be concise. Brevity is important . Get to the point, but be able to support your conclusions with any appropriate analysis. All case analysis reports are due at the beginning of the class when the case is to be discussed. Be prepared to discuss your i ndividual report with the entire class. Do not prepare a formal presentation, but be ready to be a major participant in the case discussion. You will not be graded separately on the discussion, although it will count as part of your class particip ation gra de . The following is a suggested format for organizing your case analysis report executive summary. It is up to you to decide on an appropriate format for your specific case and your specific ideas. (1) Brief diagnosis or problem definition (about one paragraph, at most one page). What is the most important problem or set of problems facing the company? What area(s) is(are) the problem(s) in? Why is it important to solve? (2) Analysis of the problem (about two pages). What caused the problem? What evidence or analysis supports your interpretation? How does the problem connect with other areas of the company or other businesses? (3) Recommendations (about four pages). What course of action do you suggest? Be specific . How does your solution follow from your prob lem analysis? How will your plan eliminate the problem? How will it be implemented? Include an action plan . How much will your plan cost? Is it feasible? How will it be financed? What are the risks of your plan? What can go wrong? Include a risk analysis . How will other actors (competitors, unions, employees, governments, suppliers, etc.) react to your plan? (4) Strategic Audit Appendix (no page limits). A complete strategic audit, as described in the textbook. Include EFAS, IFAS, SFAS, SWOT, and TOWS matrices . How to avoid the most common pitfalls of case analysis: (1) Provide a clear definition of the problem . The case materials will overwhelm you with problems. Choose th e one problem that you think is the most important . Choose your definition of the problem carefully, as the way you define the problem will determine the kinds of solutions you look for. If you define it as a marketing problem, you will seek marketing solu tions. If production, production solutions. If finance, finance solutions. And so on. (2) . Do not summarize the facts in the case. Your report is aimed at management, who know the facts. Your report will be graded by someone who knows the facts. Do not rehash facts from the case. You do want to, however, cite facts, information and statistics from the case when they are necessary to support your position. But make it clear how they are supporting your position. (3) Always perform financial analyses . 11 in Hunger & Wheelen , pp. 165 - 173 , for some of the kinds of analyses that are appropriate. (4) Support your analysis, ideas, and recommendations with adequate evidence . Again, cite facts, information and statistics from the case to justify your analysis. (5) Make sure your recommendations address the problem you defined . Do not define one problem, then by the end of the analysis be reco mmending solutions to a different problem. (6) Give practical, specific, feasible action recommendations . Make your recommendations the central focus of your paper. (7) Consider the risks . No plan is foolproof. Anticipate and prepare for risks. (8) analysis you undertook . that support your recommendation. But see numbers (2), (3), and (4). (9) - washy . Yes, there may be multiple alternatives. Yes, you may mention them. But choose one recommend best alternative. Dynamic Case Analysis Traditional case analysis, in which the reader is presented with all the information needed to develop a managerial context for strategic analysis, is an inadequate approach for conveying the managerial problems faced in environments in which technology and/or competition are moving a rapid pace a situation characterizing more and more industries. In these environments, a sense of the pace and nature of change is required, and cu rrent (or near - current) information is desirable if the strategic analysis is to have any relevance to the real world. Thus, in this course, even though most of the selected cases were written as of 200 5 to 20 12 , the written case will be merely the startin g point for setting the context. In preparing a dynamic case, the first step for the reader is to thoroughly read and understand the issues in the case material in the book including the industry analysis segment (if any). The reader should then use the ca any online databases available (such as Yahoo Finance) , as well as reviewing the current business and trade literature. Topics for updating would include technology developments, the c urrent state of the economy -- in general as well as in the target segment, a current status outline of the firm in question, changes in management or other key players, new product characteristics (including pricing), recent developments in competition, the status of the supplier and customer segment of the target segment, developments in government regulation, as well as forecasts in each of the foregoing areas. Key strategic events and issues should be identified in the update material and put into a summa ry form for discussion in class. Special attention should be paid to characterizing the nature and pace of technological and competitive change. Two of the characteristics that distinguish high technology environments from low technology environments are t he pace and rhythm of change in the underlying technology and the pace and rhythm of competitive actions in bringing that technology to market, so these elements should clearly appear in a case update. Graphs, charts, summary statistics and diagrams that c ompress the data into readily comprehensible material are especially suitable for a case update. General Rules Regarding Written Work: 1.) Use a spelling checker . 2.) Minimal grammatical errors . These rules are firm because they replicate the conditions the student should expect to find in any well - run business establishment. In general, professionally managed enterprises do not commit, nor accept, needless spelling or grammatical errors in written or presented materials. They diminish the qual ity of of the message presented. Course Policies Online Components (eLearn) : The course has a web site at where I will be posting copies of all materials, including lecture slideshows (the day after the lecture). There are also dropboxes there where you must turn in assignments. Written work is due at the beginning of class on the day it is due, and that is w hen the dropboxes close. Late papers should be submitted to the late dropboxes and will be assessed up to a 30 point (3 letter grades) penalty. E - MAIL: All students are required to maintain and access their University of Memphis (@memphis.edu) email accou nt. You will receive all official course correspondence at this email account. Any inability to Attendance: Class attendance (on time) is required at every class meeting. More than two absences will result in a deduction to the case participation grade of the student. If a student does miss a class, it is his or her responsibility to find out from c lassmates what materials were covered, what additional assignments were made, and what items may have been distributed in class . Class will begin on time . You are expected to be in your seat and ready to begin the leadoff discussion at that time. Learn t o be prompt. Showing up late to meetings shows a lack of respect, and will not help your career. Start getting used to it now, when all it can hurt is your grade. Adding / Dropping: If you have questions about adding or dropping classes, please refer to this page on the website . Academic Integrity: The University of Memphis has clear codes regarding cheating and classroom misconduct. If interested, you may refer to the Student Handbook section on academic misconduct for a discussion of these codes. Office of Student Conduct website . If you have any questions about academic integrity or plagiarism, you are strongly encouraged to review the Fogelman College's Website on Academic Integrity . Study groups are acceptable for all assignments except the individual case analysis. The individual case must be solely your own work and no discussion with other persons or collaboration of any kind is allowed on this assignment . Participation: As described above under Case Participation, participation in case discussions is a part of your final grade. I will be fully prepared for every class and expect you to be the same. I sometimes call on students whose hands are not raised, and therefore request that you advise me before class if some emergency has made it impossible for you to prepare adequately for class discussion . As described above under Attendance, miss ing classes can negatively affect your participation grade, as can tardiness. Class will begin on time. You are expected to be in your seat and ready to begin the leadoff discussion at that time. Learn to be prompt. Showing up late to meetings shows a lack of respect, and will not help your career. Start getting used to it now, when all it can hurt is your grade. I will attempt to learn your names as quickly as possible. However, to allow me to keep track of participation grades from the very beginning, I will be using a seating chart. Please sit in your assigned seats. If you do not, you will be marked absent. Classroom Behavior: All participants in the course should be considerate of the other course participants and treat them (as well as their opinions) with respect. The class will operate under the assumption that any and all feedback offered is positive in nature and that the intentions of the person(s) providing feedback are strictly honorable. Insensitivity in this area will not be tolerated. Disruptive behavior (including but not limited to coming in late, leaving during class, phone alerts or ringing, as well as audible si de conversations) will result in a deduction to the case participation grade . No recording devices are permitted in class. other uses (checking email, messaging, searching the web, etc.), or any use of a cellphone, will cause you to get a zero participation grade for that class a nd therefore count as an absence. Late Assignments: Assignments and projects may be submitted anytime up to and including the date and time due as indicated on the corresponding dropbox on eLearn . Please review all information in this syllabus and work is not submitted on time, it must be placed in the appropriate late dropbox, and the instructor wil l deduct up to 30 points (3 letter grades) depending upon the circumstances and appropriate communication between the student and the instructor. Extra Credit: As described under the Homework assignment section, extra credit is offered for additional homew ork beyond the required number, however this extra credit only affects the homework portion of your final grade (although it does make it possible to get a perfect score on homework). Reporting Illness or Absence: Due dates and deadlines have been establi shed for each graded assignment. In this course, deadlines are taken very seriously , just as they will be in the professional world . Please do not wait until the last day to ity to contact the instructor prior to the deadline to discuss the matter. A deadline extension will be considered only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) Extreme emergency and (2) Instructor contacted prior to the due date . Inclement Weath er: In the event that inclement weather requires the cancellation of classes at The University of Memphis, local radio and television media will be immediately notified. Additionally, The University of Memphis has established an Inclement Weather Hotline at 678 - 0888 as well as TigerText , an emergency alert text messaging service to students, faculty and staff. This optional service is used in the event of an on - campus emergency, an unscheduled university closing, or a delay or cancellation of classes due to, for instance, inclement weath er. Click Here for information on TigerText. Syllabus Changes: The instructor reserves the right to make changes as necessary to this syllabus. If changes are necessitated during the term of the course, the instructor will immediately notify students of such changes both by individual email communication and posting both notification and nature of change(s) on eLearn.
