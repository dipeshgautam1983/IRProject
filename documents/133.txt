All class room slides and other media will be available in eCourseware. Note that this c ourse is beginning to Page 3 of 7 may be an occasional instance of that which will be clearly identified well before that module is presented. Certain behavio rs (such as fairness, respect, responsibility and more) are important possess them. Please see the University of Memphis (see the Office of Student Conduct ) for clarification and additional expectations. Student's Expectations My personal goal is to help you gain knowledge and insight into the fundamental concepts of through the material presented, the homework assigned, the classroom and online participation and any personal experience I can share during this semester. Therefore, in my role as your instructor, there are certain things you can expect from me includin g a well - organized and engaging learning experience based on my professional experiences in multiple industries , response to emails within two (2) business days, and feedba ck on all work submitted within 7 - 10 calendar days. Student's Effort Past experience suggests that this can be a very difficult course for some. We experience in industrial, commercial or service industries; this makes absorption of the material difficult. How ever, we cover these subjects in a rather shallow manner since this is an overview course; specifically we study about 280 of the 300 page nly about 20 pages per week). However, d time you may need to read and absorb the inf ormation; you are expected to have discussion and ask clarifying questions. This is a required course for many students and is often taken as part of a full - time student course load. The expected effort is based on a full time student spending 40 hours per week after combining all of your classes, homework, teamwork, reading and other research across all of your classes. Since this 3 credit - hour course is 20% to 25% of a full time student course load, I expect you to spend 8 to 10 hours per week working on this course whether you are a full time or part time student. Since approximately 3 hours of that time will be spent in class, the remaining 5 - 7 hours are allocated to the c ourse requirements listed in this section. Therefore, most of your learning will occur outside of the classroom. Please put your investment of time and money to good use. The quantity of your time and effort spent on this class is not a factor in your gr ade (see the next section).
