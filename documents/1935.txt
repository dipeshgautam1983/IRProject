Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology About Location Teaching Staff Research Exhibition Events Resources Resources Online Bibliographic Resource Color Tour of Egypt Timeline of Egypt Other Egypt Web Sites Site Map Home Institute of Egyptian Art &amp; Archaeology Resources Timeline of Ancient Egypt Timeline of Ancient Egypt Dating Egyptian History The dates in this resource reflect the latest scholarship and are used with the permission of the late Dr. William J. Murnane. For the third millennium, dates are deliberately rounded in order to avoid a misleading appearance of precision. All dates before 664 B.C.E. should be treated as approximate. Dates following 664 B.C.E. can be taken from any standard history published in the last thirty years. For the second millennium, the dates follow closely the chronologies of Rolf Krauss and Detlef Franke. Also, the dates use B.C.E. (before Common Era) and C.E. (Common Era). These replace B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), respectively. Brief Timeline of Ancient Egypt Predynastic (ca. 4300-3000 B.C.E.) Naqada I (Amratian) (ca. 4300 - 3600 B.C.E.)
