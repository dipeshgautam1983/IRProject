Academic Advising About Find My Advisor Students Parents Advisors Contact Us Home Advising About Multi-faceted. On-going. Evolving. All to help you, find you. Most students do not enter college knowing exactly what they want to do with their lives. Declaring a major is an on-going, evolving process where you evaluate your interests, strengths, goals, and work closely with an advisor to find your academic path. With the rising cost of education and the burden of student debt hovering, we are focused on helping you find your track as quickly as possible so you can graduate in four years. The advising model we adhere to is tried and true* and incorporates the following tasks: The exploration of life goals. The exploration of vocational/career goals. The choice of program/major. The choice of courses. The scheduling of courses. *Source: Terry O'Banion Model Noel and Levitz have contributed significantly to our understanding of developmental academic advising by operationalizing O'Banion's model for advisors.
