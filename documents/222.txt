Using the Copy/Paste Feature in eCourseware Discussion Forum The D2L HTML Editor (which users will primarily encounter in Discussions, but appears just about anywhere a user can type in D2L) has problems when using Firefox 3.x on a Windows XP or a Windows 7 machine: the "copy," "cut," or "paste" icons in the HTML editor brings up the pop - up message "Copy/Cut/Paste is not available on Firefox." Users can still perform the Cut/Copy/Paste operations by using these keyboard commands instead: ON A PC : CUT = [Ctrl]+[x] COPY = [Ctrl]+[c] PASTE = [Ctrl]+[v] ON A MAC: CUT = [ (Command key)]+[x] COPY = [ (Command key)]+[c] PASTE = [ (Command key)]+[v]
