First Year Students The ASP program helps first-year students get off to a strong start with a variety of resources that are essential to success in their first year of study. The program is free and is open to all first-year students. First-year ASP consists of two components: a workshop series and individual tutorials. The "Lunch and Learn" workshop series begins early in the fall and assists students in areas such as class preparation, case briefing, study skills, and exam preparation. Lunch is provided for students while the program director presents some of the basic skills needed for success at Memphis Law. One-on-one tutorials are offered to first-year students who have questions concerning their classes or want to improve their study skills. Tutorials are conducted in individual meetings led by highly accomplished upper-level students. Upper-Level Students The ASP program is also available to upper-level students. Students can meet with Dean Aden, Director of the Academic Success Program, to seek assistance. In addition, students can meet with the ASP graduate assistants for help with study skills, exam prep, outlining, etc. The program is free and is open to all upper-level students. Students interested in finding out more information about the ASP program should email Dean Meredith Aden.
