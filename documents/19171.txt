This factsheet reports changes over time in persistence statistics for first-time, full-time freshmen STEM majors attending the University of Memphis. Students in a STEM major who initially matriculated in a fall term or began their studies in the summer are considered first-time freshmen. This includes students who entered with advanced standing (college credit earned before graduation from high school). Each student is followed for eight years (or through the most recent year available) after his/her initial term. A student who enrolled for classes in the fall term of a given year and remained in a STEM major is said to have been retained for that year. The student may change majors into a different STEM major and still be considered retained for that year. Graduation rates shown are cumulative.
