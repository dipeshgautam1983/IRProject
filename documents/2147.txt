Register for the class. You will be registered in the class for Standard grading mode; however, you will apply to have the grading mode changed to Audit. Note: If no seats are available in the course, you will first have to request that the instructor or department issue you a permit to register for the class. Read the instructions for processing the Request Permission to Audit Class form and complete the "Student" portion (Part 1) of the form. Take the form to the course instructor for approval. If the instructor agrees to allow you to audit the class, he or she will complete and sign Part 2 of the form. Then take the form to the Department Chair for final approval. Note: If the instructor declines to allow you to audit the course, you must decide whether to drop it or keep it on your schedule with Standard grading mode. If you do not want to take the class with Standard grading mode, then you should drop it. If the Department Chair approves the audit, he or she will sign and complete Part 3 of the form and either forward the completed form to the Registrar's Office, or instruct you to deliver the form there. The Registrar then changes the grade mode to Audit for the approved course.
