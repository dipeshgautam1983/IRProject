Earth Sciences The Department of Earth Sciences , created in 2002, is a program that combines archaeology, geography, and geology. It currently has 26 faculty m embers with diverse research backgrounds . Major research foci include: Earth Hazards Geophysics and Earthquake Studies Neotectonics Quaternary Studies & Geomorphology Hydrology & Water Resources GIS and Spatial Analysis Geoarchaeology At the undergraduate level the depar tment offers the B.A. degree in Earth Sciences with concentrations i n geology, geography, and geoarchaeology . fields such as cartography, environmental management, archaeology, seismology, energy, city and regional planning, soil and water c onservation, and state and federal school to receive advanced training. What opportunities can you enjoy as a student in Earth Sciences? Working closely with very act ive, award - winning research faculty Access to the Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), a center of seismic research that provides the public with information on earthquakes, seismic safety, and a 40 - station radio telemetry network extendi ng into adjacent states, providing educational opportunities for those who wish to concentration in geophysics (seismology) that is, doing six hours of your upper - division course work in Black Hills, South Dakota , and in adjacent Wyom ing. During the month - long course, you stay in dorms at Black Hills State University, in Spearfish, SD Working in our Physical Geography Lab, and in the Geological Sciences Library, located in the Resource Center at CERI. This library includes major geolo gical and geophysical journals, and USGS publications Joining the University of Memphis chapter of the Gamma Theta Upsilon, the international geographical honor society Bachelor of Arts Earth Sciences Geography Concentration * Freshman Year ENGL 1010 3 ENGL 1020 3 GE MATH 3 - 4 BA Math/Nat.
