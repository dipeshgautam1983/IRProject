Shuttles return to the Central Lot at halftime and immediately following the game. Shuttles returning riders to the Central Lot are available up until an hour after the conclusion of each home game. Shuttles are free and open to anyone with a Memphis ID or someone traveling with a person with a valid UofM ID.
