Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree BBA BBA ACCT Course Methodology This course has deadlines that have to be met, but students will be given a range of dates for completing all assignments and exams. Some of the work will require you to work outside on class. The College of Business has labs available in rooms 100 and 372 that you can use. In addition, the Tech Lab in the Student Center is available. You do not have to have Excel 2013 on your computer when you are doing the lessons because the lessons are in a simulation on SIMnet. However, there are 4 projects that will require that you have Excel 2013 on the computer you are using. You will need to either work where you hav e this software installed or if you do not have the software, you can download a free copy at: The most important expectation is that students stay engaged and complete assignments in a timely manner. The course is designed to help the student complete the work without undue pressure, but the timeline requires the student to be working both in class and out of class on a regular basis. All assignments have d efinite due dates. There will be no make - up exams, so it is expected that students plan to be in class on the day of an exam. As with all technology, there may be times when there are computer problems. Any computers problems can be addressed by one of th e options shown on the eCourseware Content Tab. Students must address any home computer technology problems quickly so that not much time lost is lost. A good suggestion is to have a backup computer plan. Grading and Evaluation Criteria Students will be evaluated in the following areas: 1. Exams 60% of grade There will be 5 exams during the semester. Each exam is worth 100 points. Each exam is 12% of your grade. Two of the exams (2 nd and 5 th ) will cover material from the Information Systems Today textbook. These exams will be online in eCourseware. Exams 1 and 3 will be on Excel applications and will be online in SIMnet. Exam 4 is a Microsoft® Office Specialist Certification Exam for Excel 2013. The exam must be given at The University of Memphis campus or at another certified testing center. Other certified agencies include the Lambuth campus and New Horizons. If the student passes the exam at the required level, the student can earn a Microsoft Certification. Certification is not required for pas sing the course; however, each student is given the opportunity to earn that certification. This exam grade will count 12% of the class grade as do each of the other exams. Students may take the Certification exam twice. The higher grade will be the exam grade for the class. 2. Projects in SIMnet 20% of grade Students will have 4 projects in SIMnet to submit for grading. Each project will be graded separately and then the average of the 4 will be the overall score for 20% of you final grad e. This is the only part of the Excel work where you must have Excel 2013 on the computer. You can choose to download a free version, work in the campus labs or at a library or any other place where you have 2013. 3. Computers Now 5% of grade Students will have tutorial lessons on SIMnet concerning the computer hardware/software. Tutorial lessons are evaluated on SIMnet. 4. PowerPoint Presentation 10% of grade Each student will create a PowerPoint presentation as assigned by the professor. 5. Business and Information Enrichment Points 5% of grade Students will be given several opportunities to earn BIT points which will enhance your overall grade. These enrichment activities will be discussed in class so that you can choose which ones (if any) you would be interested in pursuing. There is additional information about these points at the end of this syllabus and also on a separate page of the Content section for your class on eCourseware. Specific due dates will be stated for the above activities. Failure to complete items before the due date will result no credit. It can be assumed that if no due date is specified, the work is due by the end of the week in which the assignment is made, so that you are alway s up - to - date. An optional comprehensive final covering the Information Systems Today text materials and Excel applications can be substituted for a low grade on any one of the five 100 - point exams. No one has to take the comprehensive final it serves onl y to improve the grade or to make up for a test that was not taken. SIMnet grades will be posted on SIMnet as you complete the assignment, and eCourseware exams and PowerPoint Presentation will be posted on eCourseware. Both SIMnet grades and eCourseware grades will be posted on the eCourseware Grades tab during the semester. Final Course Grades A = 90% or higher B = 80 - 89% C = 70 - 79% D = 60 - 69% F = Less than 60% of total points The MIS Department does not give + (plus) or (minus) grades. Final Exam Schedule The final exam for this course will be given during the Final Exam period as scheduled on the Memphis website. This is an optional exam, but it must be taken during the time set aside for this class. Course Policies E - MAIL: I prefer that you use eCourseware/eLearn email when you plan to email me.

The BIT Professional Enrichment Program BIT Points The department of Business Information & Technology (BIT) formerly MIS has initiated a new program for all students enrolled in MIS 2749 and MIS 3210. It is the BIT Professional Enrichment program. The purpose of the BIT Professional Enrichment Program is to encourage you to participate in extracurricular events and activities th at offer learning opportunities about business careers or that enhance your personal and professional competencies (e.g., reliability, honesty, integrity, being positive, supporting others, etc.) The program works like this: you select and attend professi onal development events. In most cases, each event is worth 1 point. If you attend at least five events over the course of the semester, you will earn the maximum number of BIT points (5), which counts as five percent of your grade in this course. Procedu re to Earn BIT Point Credits: 1. Identify organizations that may be hosting events related to your major (such as the FCBE Complete Professional Program, registered student organizations, industry professional groups). Review the events and select one or more that interests you. 2. Prior to attending an event, obtain a copy of the Event Attendance Verification Form , found below. 3. If the event is NOT on the list of pre - preappr oval to get BIT point credit for attending the event. Ask your instructor to sign the form before the event to indicate approval. 4. Attend the event. After the event, ask the event sponsor representative (e.g., Kathy Tuberville, or whoever is running that ev ent) to sign the form to verify attendance. 5. Turn in the signed form to your course instructor. Notes: You are required to remain at the event for its entire duration to receive credit. It is your responsibility to discover, select, and register for events. It is also your responsibility to complete and turn in the Event Attendance Verification Form. Some events require pre - registration and/or have eligibility requirements. It is your re sponsibility to comply with the sponsoring organizations requirements for attendance.
