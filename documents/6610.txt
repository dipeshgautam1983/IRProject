Department of Theatre &amp; Dance About Academic Programs Admissions People Production Archives Home Theatre &amp; Dance Archives Becky Shaw Becky Shaw A contemporary play by Gina Gionfriddo Mainstage October 4-6 and 11-13 at 7:30 pm PHOTOS In BECKY SHAW, a newlywed couple fixes up two romantically challenged friends: wife's best friend, meet husband's sexy and strange new co-worker. When an evening calculated to bring happiness takes a dark turn, crisis and comedy ensue in this wickedly funny play. "Gina Gionfriddo's comedy of bad manners, a tangled tale of love, sex and ethics among a quartet of men and women in their thirties, is as engrossing as it is ferociously funny." —NY Times.
