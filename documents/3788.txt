Regardless of the functional specialty, the professional manager must also be a leader of people who knows how to organize and motivate groups of people serving the goals of the organization. Program objectives for a B.B.A. in Management are found here. Effective adaptation of management to such emergent conditions as the continued growth of science and technology, populations, and large-scale organization demands a thorough grasp of management process theory including planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of operations. The Management major is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of management concepts, theories and principles, which will be useful in all kinds of organizations. All management majors take courses in management principles, business communication, human resources, management, organizational behavior, international management, and strategic management. These courses and others are designed to develop knowledge of organizations and administrative processes and enhance skills in interpersonal relations, written and oral communication, and work project development and completion. The Management is intended to promote the development of general knowledge and skills that can be applied in virtually any organizational setting and which will continue to be important in the future. In addition to required core courses in management, students select among several more specialized courses to complete their majors. Management Major (B.B.A.) A.
