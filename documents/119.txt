The course will employ both graphical and mathematical methods of analysis. Beyond the development of technical skills, students will continue to develop a way of thinking that underlies all economic analysis a way of thinking that is independent of math skills and broa dly applicable to many facets of life in business, politics as well as personal decision making. Course topics include consumer behavior, the theory of the firm, market equilibrium and interference, and strategic interaction and game theory. Pre - Requisites/Co - Requisites: E CON 2020 ; knowl edge of calculus may be helpful , but not required. However, the course will use mathematics at the level of algebra very heavily. Recommended Text : The recommended text for Economics 331 0 is Microeconomics by Robe rt Pindyck and Daniel Rubinfeld . The book is currently in its 8 th edition, but the 7 th and 6 th editions are sufficiently similar for the purposes of this course. At times we will depart from material presented in the textbook. Therefore, c lass attendance is important as students will be responsible for material covered in class, even if it is not in the book. Location of Course Materials : All homework assignments (and other course documents) will be found on the eCourseware website once they are assigned . Grades will also be posted there within a reasonable amount of time after each assignment/exam is turned in. Course Objectives : By successfully completing this course, students will be able to : 1. Understand the usefulness of economic theory in explaining consumer and firm behavior. 2. U se microeconomic models to make predictions about real - world policies . 3. S ynthesize mathematical and graphical representations of economic concepts . 4. Describe in detail the underpinnings of supply and demand. 5. U nderstand the pricing decisions of firms under alternative industry conditions . 6. Analyze economic decisions under uncertainty and asymmetric information. 7. Think formally and precisely ab out strategic situations with the use of game theoretic techniques. Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for B BA omes.pdf Grading and Evaluation Criteria Over the semester, you will have a variety of opportunities to earn points towards yo ur final (overall) letter grade in this course. This section of the syllabus describes the assessed work you will be doing and how overall (final) letter grades will be computed. Summary of Graded Activities Percentage of grade Midterm Exam 1 20 Midterm Exa m 2 20 Midterm Exam 3 20 Homework Assignments 20 Final Exam 20 Total 100 Grading The first method of determining your grade will be as described in the table above, where each of the exams and your overall homework grade contribute equally (20 percent) to your overall grade. However, your grade will automatically be calculated in another way , and the higher of the two will be used as your final grade. In the second method, your lowest midterm exam grade will be dropped and the final exam grade will coun t for 40%. This is done for flexibility. There are no make - up exams after the exam date if you miss a midterm exam, it will be dropped automatically under the second method. For this rea son, it is strongly advisable not to miss an exam for avoidable reasons. Furthermore, to reward students for outstanding performance on all midterm exams, any student with a 91% average or better after midterm 3 (without dropping any homework or exa m grades) will be given an A grade in the course without having to take the final exam. Such students will be notified prior to the final exam. Homework Homework problems will be posted on the eCourseware website approximately every 1 - 2 weeks . While homeworks are graded individually, you should feel free to work on these in groups as long as you write up and turn in your own answers. Solutions to homework problems will be posted on the web shortly after the due date. Many of you will find that the concepts we cover in the course seem easy at first but that meaning until you struggle through the homeworks. Taking these homeworks seriously is therefore the single best way of studying for this course. Late homeworks will not be accepted two h omework grades will be dropped in order to allow you flexibility when you need it, such as when you are called out of town for a family emergency or you are sick.

Excessive absences may negatively affect the final grade, and attendance with earnest participation will be rewarded. I encourage students to speak up when they do not understand something I have said in class, even if it is review .
