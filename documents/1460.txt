Scheidt School of Music Program objectives for a B.M. in Music are: (a) to be prepared for entrance into accredited graduate programs in music; (b) to be prepared to pursue graduate studies in music performance; (c) to be prepared to pursue careers in the music profession. The Bachelor of Music with a major in Music is a professional degree, the requirements for which provide the student with an opportunity for specialization in the traditional disciplines of music and music education. A minimum grade of "C-" is required in every graded music course applicable toward the major. The student must maintain an overall grade point average of 2.0. Exception: Music Education concentration: overall grade point average of 2.75 and a minimum grade of "C-" in each professional education and music course. The specific degree requirements are divided into four groups: (1) University General Education Program, (2) basic music courses, (3) courses required for the specific emphasis chosen by the student, (4) electives to bring the total of semester hours taken to 120 (124 hours for Music Education choral emphasis, 125 hours for Music Education instrumental emphasis). All students must complete a minimum of 42 hours at the upper division level. Transfer students must complete a minimum of 30 semester hours of music and/or music education courses at the upper division level at the University of Memphis. Admission: All applicants seeking admission as freshman music majors or as transfer students must complete and submit to the Admissions Office of the University of Memphis an appropriate formal application form. In addition to academic considerations, admission to the music degree program requires a personal interview and an audition. The audition consists of (1) performance in the student’s major applied area, (2) a music theory examination and (3) a piano placement exam. Candidates are accepted on the basis of accomplishment, potential and suitability for the concentration they wish to pursue. Additional information on specific audition requirements and on interview/audition appointments may be obtained through the office of the School of Music or at . Music Major (B.M.) A. University General Education Program (35 hours in addition to 6 hours of Music History) See Graduation from the University for the University General Education Program requirements.
