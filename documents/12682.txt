Edward J. Meeman Biological Field Station Geography Research Education Databases Mission Statement Home Meeman Education Education Educational experiences are wide ranging at the MBFS. The station has been used extensively by several departments at the University of Memphis to conduct courses, which have a strong field study and laboratory analysis component. Local elementary schools have been invited to the MBFS to investigate flora and fauna. Several faculty in Department of Biological Sciences have provided weekend educational tours on the natural history of the Chicksaw Bluffs. These events have attracted local community members and individuals from the city of Memphis. University Educational Experiences The Department of Biological Sciences uses the field station to teach classes during the summer semester. These courses incorporate lecture, data collection in the surrounding environments, and laboratory analysis onsite at the MBFS. Several courses, including those from the Dept. of Geography, use the MFBS as a staging site for numerous class field projects along the surrounding floodplain rivers. Several instructors have established long-term study sites that are revisted each year or each semester. The long-term study sites will continue to produce data of relevance to other studies and these data will be made available to other researchers and classes upon request. Local Schools and Community Educational Experiences The Department of Biological Sciences has been involved in providing experiential learning events for students from local schools and for individuals from the Memphis metropolitan area. Several different trails on the MBFS property explore the habitats often encountered in western Tennessee. Shelby State Forest has also permitted extensive use of their properties in these learning events.
