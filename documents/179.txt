I understand that students occasionally must miss class due to legitimate work - related or personal reasons. If you miss a class, I trust you that it ' s for a good reason (i.e., I do not need a written excuse or proof of why you missed). I consider missing more than two classes to be a significant problem that will result in a lowered in - class participation grade. Due dates and deadlines have been established for each graded assignment. If an emergency arise s , it ' s the student ' s responsibility to contact the professor prior to the deadline to discuss the matter. A deadline extension will be considered only if both of the following condit ions are met: (1) e xtreme emergency , and (2) profes sor contacted prior to the due date.
