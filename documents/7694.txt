Department of Theatre &amp; Dance About Academic Programs Admissions People Production Archives Home Theatre &amp; Dance Archives Stuff Happens STUFF HAPPENS by David Hare October 7-9 and 14-16, 2010 at 8 p.m. PHOTOS "Stuff happens and it's untidy, and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things."- Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld's famous response to the looting of Baghdad, provides the title for a new, highly controversial play about the extraordinary process leading up to the invasion of Iraq. From events that have dominated headlines for most of the last decade, David Hare has fashioned both a Shakespearean history play and a human drama about the frustrations of power and the limits of diplomacy.
