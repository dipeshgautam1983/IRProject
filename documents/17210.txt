She also noted that the TBR Mi nority Fellowship is no longer being announced, since the Geier funds are scheduled to expire in 2006.

Weddle-West distributed a revised statement for members to bring before their constituents, with the aim of holding a vote at the November meeting of the council. 358.3.2 Reactions to SACS report (item 357.4.3 on September™s agenda Œ 4/6000): Members had been asked to poll their constituents about requiring the same sort of discrimination between 7000 and 8000 level cognates as is required at the 4000/6000 levels. The consensus of the various college councils is that some courses lend themselves to such differentiation and others do not. But in all cases doctoral students are held to higher standards than are master™s students. It was decided to allow the departments and colleges to make their own policies as appropriate. 358.4 New Business 358.4.1 Grade Appeals Committee Selection: four members, two regular and two alternates need to be named. J. Marchetta and L. Weiss vol unteered to be regular members; K. Hendrix and T. Sayger volunteered to be alternates. K. Weddle-West will appoint one further regular and one further alternate member from the Graduate Faculty. Recommendations for student members were solicited with the result that Beth Jacobs (ANTH) and Amanda Winters (MECH) will be asked to serve in addition to J. Fraser (GSA). Council members were asked to email suggestions for student alternates to K. Weddle-West. 358.4.2 National Defense Education Act: This re port from the CGS website contains valuable data that forces us to think deeply and differe ntly to avoid losing the US cutting edge lead in the sciences to EU institutions. It point s up the need to develop a picture of what graduate education means for the Memphis area, as well as the need to become policy- oriented. 358.4.3 Growing Graduate Enrollment Committ ee Report: This presentation demonstrated needs and strategies for increasing graduate enrollment. Although, the Provost has provided significant increases in funding to enhance stipe nds,, lack of health insurance for GAs is a major stumbling block to enrollment. D. Ze ttergren is investigating possible sources and K. Weddle-West has developed a proposal that TBR has agreed to at least look at. There was a good deal of discussion about possible strategies, though nothing specific emerged. 358.4.4 Applications, Acceptances, and Enrollment through the End of Registration: Attention was drawn to these statistics. 358.4.5 Updating of Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Status: N. Hurley explained that, in the course of updating the Guidelines to corres pond to the revised Council Bylaws, she had discovered some other anomalies. She asked Council members to review her revisions and be prepared to discuss and possibly vote on them in November. 358.4.6 A. Edwards announced that all department s must be trained in the use of MATRIX, the new document imaging program, by the end of October or the vendor will pull the product.
