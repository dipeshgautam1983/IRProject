Anthropology Anthropology is the study of people, including their biological and cultural origins, and their beliefs, customs, languages, social relationships, and values. Anthropologists explore prehistoric, historic, and contemporary peoples a round the world. The discipline offers insights into comparative ways of life, as well as strategies for improving the quality of life in diverse communities and in global context. How does training in Anthropology benefit you? Anthropological training helps students gain skills in human relations, inter - cultural and cross - cultural communications, critical thinking, writing and analysis. It is an excellent field to prepare you for jobs that involve people skills and that require an understanding of cult ural differences as well as group, system, and institutional dynamics. In addition, students develop skills in problem - solving, planning and outreach for groups and organizations. Anthropology at T he University of Memphis is especially recognized for its program in applied anthropology, including the subfields of urban and medical anthropology, as well as museum studies. Majors in other fields will also find the Anthropology minor a profitable addition to their course of study. Graduates of our program c an be found in business, education, independent foundations, medical facilities, social agencies, or government agencies that involve internation al or cross - cultural relations.
