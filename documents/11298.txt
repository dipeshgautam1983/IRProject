U of M Social Media Handbook Page 3 of 17 Revised: 11/12/2014 Revised: 11/12/2014 1 Social Media Strategy 1.1 Comprehensive Strategy The overall strategy is one that organizes the University of Memphis social media efforts and incorporates social media as an integral piece of the University’s overall c ommunication strategy. By all University departments working in concert, social media avenues allow for discussion of University initiatives, engagement of alumni and donors , recruitment of students and creation of dialogue surrounding our community and e ducational efforts. Clearly, social media is not a one size fits all. The message for each platform and audience will need adaptation to best align with how followers interact. Senior alumni do not use social media as frequently as the 90+ hours current student segment, new grads segment and growing families segment (Classes of 1992 -present). Social media influencers will need to be directly engaged and designated from the observers. 1.2 Goals 1. Create a collaborative and comprehensive campus -wide branding a nd social media environment. a. Create and coordinate the University Branding Council comprised of members from across the University community. Working with the Office of the President and University Communications, the Council will create policy and brand ing standards and review marketing campaigns from all the areas of campus to ensure that University messaging and priorities are consistent. b. Organize meetings of the social media coordinators from throughout the campus and e nsure that all account administ rators are informed of policies and University priorities. c. Form a Social Media Forum Team to c reate an approval/review process for all University social media accounts and review all current accounts for policy standards alignment. d. Implement best practi ces policies for all University accounts, publish those policies on the web and notify accounts of policies. e. Create a University of Memphis Social Media Directory and publicize existence of such when all official accounts have been reviewed and notified o f policies. f. Develop standard hashtags to fuel conversations regarding the University - specifically on Twitter and Instagram. 2. Enforce and strengthen the University of Memphis brand through social media. a. Advance likes, retweets, followers, pins, etc. wi th an increased percentage tied to each platform thereby increasing audience awareness of brand. U of M Social Media Handbook Page 4 of 17 Revised: 11/12/2014 Revised: 11/12/2014 b. Use monitoring tools to measure engagement and reach. These tools will verify the success gained or lost by tailoring the message to a particular audience on a specific social media platform . c. Coordinate the “look” of each University account to make sure trademarks and school colors are displayed appropriately. Safeguard consistency in style and priorities for social media across campus while recognizing the need to tailor each account for most cohesive tone and look. d. Participate in trending topics to position the University as a cred ible and informed source recogn izing that trust and audiences d o not occur immediately. e. Increase exposure of social media acco unts by the use of traditional media – print ads, websites, etc. f. Share key university news and messages, and engage audiences – do not just make announcements. E nsure that social media remains social. g. Install social media messaging boards in heavily tra fficked student areas to increase student engagement, awarene ss of U niversity social media and build a vivacious social media presence. 3. Use social media platforms as retention vehicles to strengthen the “experience” of the University of Memphis students, faculty, staff and alumni. a. Answer or direct questions to the appropriate U of M offices with confirmation of communication with the inquirer. b. Use keyword searches on social networks to monitor conversations and respond accordingly. c. Develop plans for e mergency notifications and situational messaging for the students, staff, faculty, parents of students and the communities we serve. 4. Monitor and respond to social media trends, joining new platforms and transitioning away from outdated ones, sustaining re sources and keeping audiences engaged. a. Keep sites dynamic in order to maintain a robust audience and question a unit’s audience and goals to insure the best use of resources. b. Meet with local national companies (AutoZone, FedEx) to discuss what platforms they are using and what trends they are experiencing. 5. Be a thought leader in social media. a. Use the social media platforms as a way to demonstrate to others that the University of Memphis is an influencer in public discussions. b. Gain respect and trust by taking place as an invited guest in conversations concerning the University of Memphis. U of M Social Media Handbook Page 5 of 17 Revised: 11/12/2014 Revised: 11/12/2014 c. Create content designed to stimulate positive discussion and engagement about the University of Memphis. d. Handle controversy immediately, transparently and positively . LISTEN to our constituents. e. Solicit feedback and conduct information polls to enhance the reputation of the University of Memphis social media presence as a vital forum for conversation. 1.3 Strategy at W ork To build a dynamic social media presence, the Un iversity will first organize and review its current practices and accounts. From there, the newly created University Branding Council and Social Media Forum Team will review best p ractices and the strategy for our future through designing the roadmap for the image, content and goals concerning the University of Memphis branding and social media initiative.

Social networking sites expand one’s reach immensely, and there are many valuable uses of these networks. Because social networking is so accessible and has blurred the lines between personal and private, there are a number of concerns with social networking sites of which students should be aware. Realize that information posted without using appropriate privacy settings may be available to anyone including University faculty, current or prospective emplo yers, graduate school admissions officers and many others. Students should conduct themselves in a way that exemplifies the socially responsible and honorable behavior expected of all University students. While the University encourages this online colla boration, provided are University policies and guidelines for appropriate online conduct in order to avoid the misuse of this communication medium.
