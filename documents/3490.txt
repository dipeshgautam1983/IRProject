To be useful that information must be understandable, timely, thorough, focused on the decision at hand, and in the hands of the appropriate individual. Accomplishing all this is the challenge of Management Information Systems. It requires a knowledge of individual and/or group behavior, the process of perception (how people select and interpret information), the decision tools they need, computers and communication technology, systems design, managing data, and the impact individual decisions have on the organization. Program objectives for a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems are found here. Management Information Systems includes several specialized areas including Telecommunications, Information Systems, Management and Planning, Statistics, System Development, Data Base Management, and general applications of computers to business. Many Management Information Systems courses require substantial hands-on experience in computer labs. Therefore, the department does not allow credit by examination for upper division courses.
