History and mission of the School of Public Health The University of Memphis received approval from the Tennessee Board of Regents to establish a Master of Public Health (MPH) program in August, 2006 and accepted its first students in the Fall of 2007. Subsequently, the Tennessee Higher Education Commissio n (THEC) approved the establishment of a School of Public Health (SPH) at The University of Memphis in November, 2007. The SPH became an independent entity of The University of Memphis in July, 2009. T he SPH currently offers the MPH program and Master of H ealth Administration degree , along with doctoral programs in Social and Behavioral Sciences and in Epidemiology. The University o f Memphis , School o f Public Health is dedicat ed to excellence in education, research, and outreach to improve public health a nd promote health equity by generating knowledge and translating research discoveries in our community, our state, and throughout the world. We aspire to: 1. Train the next generation of students in population health by providing the highest quality education and practice opportunities in theories, approaches, methods, and other substantive issues pertinent to public health. 2. Create an environment conducive to interdisciplinary public health initiatives, with special emphasis on vulnerable populations who suffer disproportionately from illness and disability. 3. Stimulate collaboration with the community to develop effective partnerships in combating the he alth challenges in our communities, city, state, and region. 4. Prepare future leaders in public health by supporting interdisciplinary research focused on health equity to develop behavioral, community, structural, and health services interventions that address disparities. 5. Inform public policy, disseminate health information, and increase awareness of public health concerns through disease surveillance, needs assessments, and program evaluation. II.

Tran sfer Credits and Credit by Exam Transfer credits Previously earned credits not counted toward any degree may be considered for transfer by the student's advisory committee in accordance with the Graduate School policy . According to Graduate School regulations, credit hours with a grade of B or better may be transferred if course work was earned at an institution accredited at the graduate level. These courses: 1) must not have been used for a previous graduate degree; 2) must relate to the content of a degree program and/o r be comparable to those offered at the U of M; and 3) must not have been completed more than 6 years (8 years for 36 hour or more degree program) before anticipated date of graduation. These course(s) must have met for a minimum of 750 contact minutes for each semester hour credit (2250 minutes for a 3 - hour course). An official transcript must be on file at the U of M at the time of this request. Transfer grades will not be computed in the U of M cumulative GPA. The necessary form s for both the masters a nd doctoral students are available section of the Graduate School website: . Upon completion o f this form, return to the Graduate School (AD 215) with the appropriate signature for processing. Credit by exam I n cases where the student has knowledge, but has not taken the appropriate course, the academic units, with approval from the Vice Provost for Graduate Programs or designee, may offer graduate courses for credit by examination. Total credit - by - examination applied to a student's degree program 7 may not exceed nine (9) semester hours.

All of performance. Faculty members outside the exam committee may also attend the exam session but will Evalua tion Each question will be evaluated and graded by at least two committee members independently. In special circumstances, faculty members outside the committee may be invited to grade some questions. The final grade of each written question will be the m ean of the two grades for that question, and any discrepancies will be discussed between the graders and the exam committee chair. Scoring less that 60 out of 100 on any one question is considered unsatisfactory for that question. If a student scores below 70 on any particular question, he/she will be asked to clarify the answers to that question during his/her oral exam. However, if a student scores less than 60 out of 100 on more than one general question, he/she is considered to fail the overall comprehe nsive exam. The student is allowed to take the oral exam only if he/she has passed the written exam. Oral exam evaluation will be performed by the full committee at the end of the exam session. Only pass or fail will be recorded for the oral exam. If the student fails the oral exam, he/she is considered to have fail ed the comprehensive exam.

Oral Defense of Proposal For this purpose, the student will submit her/his dissertation proposal to the committee and ask for an oral defense 5 weeks af ter submission of her/his dissertation proposal. 19 Advisor and dissertation committee The g academic advisor should play several critical roles in the advancement of an advisee. The a dvisor should guide his/her beginning t hrough completion of the program . Advising generally begins before the student arrives on campus and should be based on professional goals when they are admitted to the program. The a dvisor should work with the advisee to develop the determine which courses will be taken each semester based on student the program requirements. The advisor should consider options such as , as well as the timing of course offering s within the School of Public Health , when registering for classes . Occasionally the student may be asked by the advisor and/or the chair of the dissertation committee to assist with teaching, and /or to wo should be viewed as an intrinsic part of the learning process, and an opportunity to grow professionally. After the end of the first year or a minimum of 18 credit hours , the student should assemble the dissertation committee. The academic advisor may serve as chair of the dissertation committee, but the student is free to seek a different chair of her/his dissertation committee . The dissertation committee shou ld consist of 4 faculty members with at least 3 members being from EBE . These faculty members should hold an appointment as Assistant Professor or higher and have a graduate faculty status. One adjunct or one research faculty member may serve on the Committee, but not t wo . Only one committee member may be from outside the division or the University of Memphis. In the event of an invited committee member from outside the University of Memphis, the division must follow the Graduate School guideline for such appointments ( ) . The Dissertation Faculty Committee Form must be completed and submitted to the graduate sch ool as soon as the committee is formed. The Faculty Committee Form ( ) . Dissertation guidelines All doctoral students must complete an original investigation presented in the form of a dissertation. The dissertation must be based on original research based on ei ther primary data collection or secondary data analysis, of publication quality, and acceptable to the EBE and to a committee of dissertation readers. The traditional doctoral dissertation consists of a statement of the questions or hypotheses , specific aims, and related hypotheses; a literature review; explanation of research methodology, data collection procedure, analysis of data, presentation of results; and a discussion of findings and their public health implications. Students also have the option o f completing a manuscript - oriented dissertation as an alternative to the traditional dissertation. In case of the second option, students should prepare three published or publishable manuscripts on the subthemes derived from the main dissertation topic. T hese three manuscripts will consist the mid 3 chapters of the dissertation and should be accompanied by the first introductory chapter that introduces the overarching theme and one concluding chapter that synthesizes all of the findings. Students should di scuss both options with their advisor before deciding on a dissertation strategy. 20 A satisfactory investigation and its presentation in the form of a dissertation approved by a committee complete the written portion of the dissertation requirement. The material contained in the dissertation should be of a publication quality in scientifi c journal(s) in the relevant field. The dissertation must adhere to the format outlined by the Graduate School Oral Defense of Dissertation schedule at time for the oral defense of their dissertation.

After the defense, the thesis committee votes to approve or disapprove the thesis. ( ) with her/him to their defense. Once the student has successfully defended her/his dissertation the committee will complete the form and submit it to the graduate coordinator. When scheduling the oral defense, t he student should be mindful of the graduate school deadlines for submitting completed dissertations. The deadlines can be found at . H. Graduation Requirements Students must apply to graduate and submit the doctoral candidacy form in the semester before they and specific instructions for f illing out these forms can be found .

Laboratory policy At present, SPH has two working wet - laboratories (room s 325 and 333), and one stand - by laboratory (room 332) that are used for research and training purposes. These laboratories have several analytical instruments to facilitate public health research. Laboratory Access for students who will work in SPH laboratories T o gain access to the SPH laboratories, students must attend appropriate training(s) for compliance with U niversity of M emphis policies including (but not limited to) management of hazardous chemicals, sources of ionizing radiation, and biological agents. These training sessions ar e administered by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) to ensure proper employee training and workplace EH&S website: . Access to the laboratory is granted by respective laboratory principal investigator s (PI) . Upon recommendation from the PI(s), the student will receive a laboratory access card from the SPH Busines s Office. This access card will be deactivated when the student is no longer associated with the laboratory. E . C ivil Rights and Non - Discrimination Polic y The U of M shall not, on the basis of a protected status, subject any student to discrimination under any educational program. No student shall be discriminatorily excluded from participation or denied the benefits of any educational program on the basis o f a protected status. It is the intent of the University of Memphis that each campus of the University shall be free of harassment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age or any other protected status and shall fully comply with the anti - harassment provisions of Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, the federal and state constitutions, and all other applicable federal and state statutes. The Unive rsity specifically finds that diversity of students, faculty, administrators and staff is a crucial element of the educational process and reaffirms its commitment to enhancing education through affirmative action to increase diversity at all levels. F . Funding The EBE Division is committed to seeking opportunities that will allow it to provide financial support to its students. Most full - time eligible accepted applicants will automatically be considered for School of Public Health scholarship suppor t in the form of graduate assistantships. Departmental scholarship 23 decisions are made during the admissions process and communicated to students in their letters of acceptance. Limited federal assistance, in the form of work - study, Stafford Loans, or Perk ins Loans, is also available. Contact the Office of Student Aid at (901) 678 - 2303 for more information. VA benefits and Title IV funds for enrollment fees are subject to cancellation and immediate repayment if the recipient stops attending, whether or not he/she has withdrawn or dropped a course. The instructor will report the last known date of attendance as the unofficial withdrawal date.

Faculty will support students when applying for Individual Pre - doctoral Awards. G . Academic Calendar Academic year calendars mark the major activity dates (class start/end dates, exam dates, and commencement) of each term and its parts. Each Academic Year begins with the Fall term and ends at the conclusion of the Summer term. Academic calendars are avail able from the Office of the Registrar and can be accessed at: Students wanting registration, add/drop, fee payment, etc., dates and deadlines for a pa rticular, immediate term should review the Dates & D eadlines Calendar for that term. H . Withdrawing from the Program and Leave of Absence Students are admitted to our program because they have shown exceptional performance as a student, have terrific letters of reference, have expressed an interest in being trained in epidemiology, and have rs. Occasionally, students discover that their career interests have changed, and once in a while a student will withdraw from the program to pursue these other interests. In this situation, we strongly suggest that the student schedule a meeting with his or her faculty advisor and the Division Director . There are several purposes to this meeting: First, faculty could answer questions about how to go about withdrawing from the program, and second, the student could share some direct feedback about the stre ngths and weaknesses of the program. In some cases, a student may benefit from a Leave of Absence instead of a withdrawal, and your faculty advisor can provide you with information about this option, if needed. I . Parental Leave Policy Graduate studen ts may request parental leave following the adoption or birth of a child. Parental leave applies to either parent. If both parents are graduate students, both may request simultaneous parental leave. The leave begins on the day the graduate student or post doctoral fellow is no longer fully engaged in their professional and academic activities and, to the extent possible, should be requested in advance of a birth or adoption. Retroactive requests will be considered on a case - by - case basis. 24 J . Loan Deferme nt A student with an outstanding Federal Stafford loans may not be required to pay on these loans while enrolled as a graduate student in the program. Students must complete a loan deferment form during his/her period of enrollment at the School of Public Health. All loan deferment forms should be taken directly to the Registrar's Office in 003 Wilder Tower. This office is responsible for enrollment certification. F or further information on loan deferment and enrollment verification, contact the Office of Financial Aid at 901 - 678 - 4825. K . Inclement Weather Policy Call 678 - 0888 for the latest information on class cancellations due to inclement weather. Alternatively, you may register to receive TigerText messages on your cell phone in which you will be notified of university closings and other emergency alerts. To register, visit and log in using your U of M UUID and password. Be sure to have your cell phone handy to complete the registration process. L . Grievance Procedures n arise that requires mediation to reduce/resolve conflict. The program has a plan for this. We recommend that you take the following actions for expressing concerns, if possible, in this order: 1. Go to the person with whom you have a complaint and try to co me to a resolution. 2. Go to your D irector of the Epidemiology PhD program to address the issue. 3. Go to the Graduate Coordinator. 4. Place a written complaint in the mail box of the EBE Division Director 5. Go directly to the EBE Division Director to address the issue. 6. Form a Grievance Committee as specified below. At any time you may go to a Graduate Student Coordinating Committee ( GSCC ) member to discuss the issue confidentially (if you desire, the GSCC representatives will meet with the appropriate administrator to inform them of the concern and/or to discuss possible ways to resolve the concern). You may also contact the GSCC by email or you can put a written complaint into the GSCC mailbox. Considerations for forming a Grievance Committee : 1. A student acknowledges that by taking an issue to the Grievance Committee that it is likely to be necessary to notify the person to whom the co mplaint is directed towards in an effort to remedy the situation. 2. It is possible that additional people may be contacted in order to gather information pertaining to the complaint (e.g., if a complaint is about mentoring, bring in other students of the mentor 25 to inquire about their experiences with the mentor). 3. The Grievance Committee should be used only when other points of contact for grievances have not yielded a satisfactory resolution. A person may choose to go to the department chair rather th an to the committee. 4. A grievance can be brought by one or more students or can be presented by a GSCC representative for a group of students. It is important to recognize that the names of students bringing the grievance will not be confidential as the accused person has the right to know who is lodging the complaint against them. Formation of Grievance Committee : 1. The Grievance Committee will consist of three faculty members (a chair plus two additional tenured faculty members) 2. The members of the Grievance Committee will not be permanent but rather will be selected for each individual case. 3. The selection of these committee members will be done in the following way: a. The student bringing the grievance will select one of the faculty to be t he chair. It is advised to remedy the situation by contacting this individual. b. The selected chair will choose one tenured faculty member to serve on the com mittee. c. The student will choose one tenured faculty member to serve on the committee. d. It is advisable that the selected chair and the student confer on their selections. Function of the committee : 1. The committee will attempt to mediate the grieva nce and find a resolution. 2. The committee can make recommendations to the Department Chair. The Department Chair does have the power to over - ride decisions made by the committee. Notes and Explanations : 1. No student will be on the committee because it would put the student in a compromising situation to have to make decisions regarding faculty who may be their teacher or mentor. The ability of the student to choose two of the three committee members gives an enormous amount of power to the student b ringing the grievance, likely more so than having a student on the committee. 2. No non - tenured faculty will be able to be on the committee because it would put them in a compromising situation to have to make decisions that could impact their ability to receive tenure. 3. Some aspects of the grievances are not confidential. If a student wishes to communicate a primary goal is to work out a resolution. This requires both parties being notified of the 26 grievance. Confidentially would be maintained to any individuals outside those that must be notified in order to reach a resolution. More information can be found in the Graduate Handbook and the University Bulletin. V I . Student Support Services at the University of Memphis A.
