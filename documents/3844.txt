Updated: 10 / 10 /2014 Page 1 of 2 um Drive: Direct Weblink/Intellilink What is a Direct Weblink/Intellilink? Each file and folder within um D rive has a full URL and an abbreviated link. This shorter, abbreviated link is also known as the file's Intellilink because it uses Intellittach technology to create a shorter link which is useful in preventing the URL from wrapping once it is automatically pasted into an e - mail message. Once the Intellilink is pasted into an e - mail message, the link should not wrap and thus allows a recipient to simply click on the link to access the file. This link also automatically launches the um D rive interface when it is clicked. Locate the Intellilink for a File or Folder 1. Navigate to the file or folder you wish to share. Place a check in the box next to its name. 2. In the Menu bar, click the Manage button (A) and select S um mary (B). The S um mary for the file or folder will display. Updated: 10 / 10 /2014 Page 2 of 2 3. On the S um mary screen the Full URL and Intellilink URL will be the second and third rows (see below): Now that you have located the Intellilink you can give this to other users so they may access your file or folder. Be sure you have given the user(s) appropriate permissions. If you need help with this, instructions can be found in the File Sharing, Permissions, and Tickets guide.
