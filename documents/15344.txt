The concert will benefit the Hal &amp; Teresa Freeman Nursing Scholarship for Veterans. While there is no admission charge, donations will be accepted to benefit the scholarship. American Pride, a tribute band of the Statler Brothers, will perform. They have played on CMT and at the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium. Music Entertainment students from the Lambuth Campus, led by Dr. Jeremy Tubbs, also will perform. The concert was inspired by Hal Freeman's love of serving veterans and Teresa Freeman's love of nursing. Hal, an instructor and veteran coordinator at UofM Lambuth, is a veteran of the U.S. Navy submarine service. Teresa has been a nurse for 29 years and is assistant chief nursing officer and clinical informatics officer for West Tennessee Healthcare. "Since everyone's life has either been touched by a nurse or a veteran, we decided to let the audience choose how much they want to get involved through a donation," said Hal Freeman. "We did not want to set a ticket price to get in." Contact Hal Freeman at 731-425-1907 for more information.
