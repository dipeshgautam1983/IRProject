It allows multiple staining protocols to be run simultaneously with up to 11 slide racks at the same time. A unique feature of the Leica Autostainer is the ability to perform several different staining protocols at once. During long staining procedures, the Leica Autostainer offers a continuous loading system which ensures optimal use of the instrument. For example, a special staining can be performed while a routine H &amp; E staining procedure is in progress. Click here to learn more about the Leica Autostainer XL ST5010 Applications Staining is a process by which tissue sections are dyed or given color in order to visualize the tissue morphology. The most common method of histological study is to prepare thin sections (3-5 micron) from paraffin embedded tissues in order to effectively stain the tissue sections. This process involves the removal of the paraffin wax from the section, the hydration of the section and finally the staining of the thin section of tissue. There many different stains and staining techniques. One common staining procedure, hematoxylin and eosin or the H&amp;E staining procedure, uses hematoxylin to stain cell nuclei (and other parts) blue and an eosin dye to stain the cytoplasmic elements and other structures pink or red. Routine Hematoxylin and Eosin staining is the primary means of staining tissue sections and is the cornerstone of tissue based diagnosis. Properly applied, this technique provides exceptional detail of tissue structure and the makeup of the cells. This detail is required for tissue-based diagnosis, particularly in the detection and classification of cancer. Special stains use a variety of dyes and techniques to stain particular tissues, structures or pathogens (such as bacteria) to assist with tissue-based diagnosis. There are hundreds of stains available.
