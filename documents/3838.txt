The eastern edge of Memphis became the site for West Tennessee State Normal School, which in 1929 became West Tennessee State Teachers College. In 1941, the college expanded its curriculum in liberal arts, and the name was changed to Memphis State College, an institution serving three to four thousand students. The undergraduate program was reorganized into three schools and a graduate school was added in 1951. Memphis State achieved university status in 1957.

Eligible students may enroll concurrently in undergraduate and select graduate courses. Approval to register for graduate credit does not imply approval for admission into a graduate program at the University or that the credit earned will be accepted towards a graduate degree. After the bachelor's degree is awarded, a Combination Senior/Graduate Non- Degree student must make formal application in order to be admitted to a graduate degree program. Courses taken for graduate credit may not be used for both the baccalaureate and graduate degree. Combination seniors are not eligible for graduate assistantships. Graduate Non-Degree: This classification is for domestic students who wish to enroll in graduate courses but who do not wish to pursue a graduate degree at the University or whose applications are incomplete. Graduate non-degree applicants must show proof of having earned a baccalaureate degree at the time of application. At the end of the first semester of course work, the Graduate Non-Degree student may be required to furnish an official transcript showing at minimum a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. Academic units may restrict non-degree students to designated courses. Graduate Non-Degree students who decide to matriculate for a degree must make application to the Graduate School and must meet all admissions requirements. Master's students in programs requiring 36 credit hours or fewer are limited to 12 credit hours while in non-degree status. Students in degree programs requiring more than 36 hours must take at least 2/3 of the credit hours after acceptance into the program. Students should note that some academic units count coursework toward a degree only after admission or have more restrictive policies regarding the number of non-degree hours that count toward the degree. Before registering for a second semester of graduate level coursework, the non-degree student is required to sign a release agreeing that additional coursework will not apply to degree programs. Non-degree students must maintain a 3.00 GPA in graduate courses in order to re-enroll and are not eligible for graduate assistantships. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION Hepatitis Vaccination The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee mandates that each public or private post-secondary institution in the state provide information concerning Hepatitis B infection to all students entering the institution for the first time. Those students who will be living on campus must also receive information about the risk of meningococcal meningitis infection. After reading this information and prior to registering for classes, you must complete and sign the waiver form to indicate that you have received the information and have chosen to have the vaccination, plan to have the vaccination, or chosen not to have the vaccination. The waiver form is on-line at: .Measles Vaccination Catalog--Admission 12:15:23 PM]The University of Memphis requires all students born after January 1957 to have had the measles (MMR) vaccination after January 1, 1980, in order to register.

Residency Classification Determinations concerning the classification of graduate students as in-state or out-of-state for fee purposes are made in Graduate Admissions. The determinations are based on the regulations and guidelines of the Tennessee Board of Regents. See "Expenses" for further information. The residency guidelines differ from and are independent of guidelines used to determine residency for other purposes, such as tax classification for fee paying purposes, it is his or her responsibility to check with Graduate Admissions. Application for reclassification must be made to the classification officer on or before the last day of regular registration of that semester. Veterans Services Mission: The Office of Veterans Services, 003 Wilder Tower, provides assistance for eligible National Guard/Reserves, veterans, and/or dependents who enroll at the University of Memphis and who make application for programs of education or training, and VA tutorial services. Other assistance includes: liaison with Veterans Administration Regional Office, counseling, and counseling referral for personal, family, career, financial, and educational problems. Application for VA benefits: Those who will be using VA educational assistance while enrolled at the University of Memphis should contact the Office of Veterans Services. They should also be prepared to furnish the following items as applicable: 1. The number 4 original or copy of the DD214 or other armed forces separation papers. 2. Copy of Delayed Enlistment Contract. 3. 4. Copy of final divorce decree if either veteran or spouse has been previously married. 5. VA file number if different from social security number. Advance Pay: Advance payment is available for eligible veterans and dependents who plan to enroll on at Catalog--Admission 12:15:23 PM]least a half-time basis. Applications will be accepted in the Veterans Services Office as early as 120 days before the term begins but no later than 45 days before the beginning entry. Generally, the advance pay deadline for the fall semester is around July 15, while spring semester deadline is around November 15. Advance pay checks include an allowance for the month or fraction thereof in which the course begins and the allowance for the following month. Advance pay checks are mailed to the school for delivery to the student at registration. Initial applicants who do not apply for advance pay may expect their check to be mailed to their home within six to eight weeks after registration. Enrollment Status: For VA benefits during the regular terms (Fall and Spring), 12 semester hours constitute a full-time load for undergraduate students; 9 hours is full-time for graduate students. However, training time for summer session at the undergraduate and graduate level is based on the number of semester hours attempted per term. The Veterans Administration places restrictions on those who receive veterans educational benefits. Some of these restrictions include: (1) regular class attendance, (2) satisfactory academic progress, and (3) adherence to a specific degree plan. Degree Plan: Only courses that are required for the degree and major may be certified for VA pay. VA will not pay for repeat courses if the grade already earned is accepted by the U of M and will fulfill graduation requirements toward the declared degree and major (even if the course was taken at another institution with or without use of the GI Bill). VA will not pay for elective courses in excess of those needed to meet graduation requirements. Although advisors are provided for veterans, this assistance does not relieve students of the responsibility for fulfilling all VA and University requirements. Certification: Enrollment certifications are mailed and/or electronically submitted to the appropriate VA Regional Office upon receipt of the Veterans Request for Certification Form. Students are required to submit this form to the Veteran Services Office at the University of Memphis each semester. Students will be certified on a term-by-term basis. Pre-certification will be done only when a request for advance pay is made.Termination of Benefits: VA benefits and Title IV funds for enrollment fees are subject to cancellation and immediate repayment if the recipient stops attending, whether or not he/she has withdrawn or dropped a date." Students who stop attending will be assigned a grade of "F" in courses that do not reflect an official withdrawal.ROTC Programs Graduate students are eligible to earn a commission as a second lieutenant in the US Air Force by completing 12 semester hours of the AFROTC advanced program in conjunction with their graduate studies.

Students will be expected to do more work, such as an additional paper or additional higher level readings, to receive graduate credit. Students may not receive credit for a 6000 level course if they have credit at the 4000 level. 6000 level courses must be taught by members of the Graduate Faculty Faculty Course Load Limitations Fifteen semester hours of coursework is the maximum load for students devoting full time to graduate study during regular sessions. The maximum total number of hours of graduate course work for which a graduate student may enroll during the Summer Session is 12. Those who register for 9 or more hours per semester in the academic year will be considered full-time students. University-funded graduate assistants must register for no fewer than 12 hours credit per semester (or 6 thesis/dissertation hours) in both the Fall and Spring terms. school. Students in the School of Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology must obtain the approval of the director of graduate studies in that school. Audit Courses Students who are admitted to the University of Memphis may register to audit a course with the prior approval of the instructor and the head of the academic unit or designate. Students enrolling on an audit basis do not receive academic credit for that course. Particularly in high-demand courses, academic units Catalog--Academic Regulations--Part 12:15:24 PM]should make sure that students who need these courses for degree credit can be accommodated before they issue permits for audits. Audits should not be used simply as a vehicle for obtaining access to laboratory or studio facilities. Auditors are not required to take examinations and do not receive a regular letter grade. The student and the instructor should reach a precise agreement as to the extent and nature of the students participation in the course, including class discussion, projects, and readings. Students auditing a course will receive "audit" (AD) on the transcript only if they have attended regularly and participated according to the prior agreement with the instructor. A student may not change from a grade point basis to audit or from audit to a grade point basis after the last day to add classes for that session. Any questions concerning this policy should be referred to the colleges.Fees for audits will be assessed on the same basis as fees for credit courses. Attendance Requirements for attendance in any graduate course will be determined by the instructor and must be communicated in writing to students in the first class meeting. Changing a Major or Advancing from a Master's to a Doctoral Program Students who have previously declared a major but desire to make a change or who wish to advance from a master's program to a doctoral program should apply to Graduate Admissions to begin the process by completing a Change of Status form. A change of major is considered the equivalent of reapplying for admission. All admission requirements of the new major or program must be satisfied before a change can be granted; admission to the new program is not automatic. Adding and Dropping Courses Courses may be added or dropped after initial registration for a limited time only. Refer to the Student Calendar at for appropriate deadlines. Courses may be added late only upon approval of the instructor and the director of graduate studies in the student's college. Students in the School of Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology or University College must obtain the approval of the director of graduate studies in those units. Courses may be dropped after the drop date only when circumstances beyond the student's control make it impossible to complete the semester. Late drops must be approved by the director of graduate studies in the student's college. Students enrolled on a non-degree basis must obtain the approval of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies or designee. VA benefits and Title IV funds for enrollment fees are subject to cancellation and immediate repayment if the recipient stops attending, whether or not he/she has dropped a course. Withdrawal from Graduate School A graduate student may withdraw from the University after the drop date only when circumstances beyond the director of graduate studies in the student's college and submitted to the Graduate School. Students enrolled on a non-degree basis must obtain the approval of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies or designee. VA benefits and Title IV funds for enrollment fees are subject to cancellation and immediate repayment if the recipient stops attending, whether or not he/she has withdrawn. Grading System GradesThe table below shows the grades that may be awarded with their quality points: Catalog--Academic Regulations--Part 12:15:24 PM]PLUS/MINUS GRADING SCALE GRADEQUALITY POINTS GRADEQUALITY POINTS A+4.00C+2.33A 4.00C 2.00A-3.84C-1.67B+3.33D+1.33B 3.00D 1.00B-2.67F 0.00Grades used to postpone or suspend course completion include "I" (incomplete), "IP" (in progress), and "W" (withdrawn). Independent studies courses, student teaching, workshops, practica, internships, theses, and dissertations should be graded "A-F, IP" or "S/U, IP." Courses designated with a "single dagger" in the listing of courses are graded "S" (Satisfactory), "U" (Unsatisfactory), or "IP (In Progress). Those designated with a "double dagger" are graded "A"-"F," or "IP." A grade of "S,""U," or "IP," does not carry any quality points and is not included in computing GPA. Incomplete: The grade "I" (Incomplete) may be assigned by the faculty member in any course other than beyond the individual's control that are acceptable to the faculty member. The "I" may not be used to extend the term for students who complete the course with an unsatisfactory grade. Unless the student completes the requirements for removal of the "I" within 90 days from the end of the semester or summer session in which it was received (see University Calendar), the "I" will change to an "F," whether or not the student is enrolled. The faculty member may grant up to a 45-day extension if sufficient extenuating circumstances exist. At the end of the extension period, the "I" grade will automatically revert to "F" if the student has not completed the requirements. The student will be certified for graduation only when all requirements are met, including the removal of "I" grades. If a student has an "I" in a course necessary to fulfill degree requirements in the semester in which he or she expects to graduate, the certification process and graduation will automatically be deferred to the next term. In Progress: In courses with "IP" (In Progress) grading, faculty members may assign "IP" to extend the time permitted for the completion of research or course requirements. A student awarded an "IP" grade must re-enroll in the course for the same number of hours to complete the work. Students must re-enroll in thesis or dissertation courses but the hours may vary. The final grade will be submitted by the faculty member at the end of the term in which the work is completed. Thesis/Dissertation Grading: The use of S, U, IP grading for theses and dissertations is different from its Students must enroll for at least 1 thesis or dissertation hour for each semester (except for summer sessions) that they are working on the thesis or dissertation. Grade Point Average: Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 GPA ("B"). Grades of "D" and "F" will not apply toward any graduate degree, but will be computed in the GPA. No more than 7 hours of "C-," "C" or "C+" will be applied towards meeting degree requirements. Grades earned at another university will not be computed in the cumulative GPA. Grades in courses that are older than the time limitation for degree will be shown on the transcript but will not be included in the computation of the GPA used for graduation. Only courses that have been validated will count toward the degree (see below for validation policy). Repetition of Courses: A graduate student may repeat a course to earn a higher grade only if the earned grade was lower than a "B" (3.0). No course may be repeated more than once to improve the grade. Only Catalog--Academic Regulations--Part 12:15:24 PM]the grade earned in the second attempt will be included in the computation of the cumulative grade point average. A maximum of two courses may be repeated during the student's total graduate career to improve a grade. However, if a student advances to a doctoral program and wishes to repeat a third course at the doctoral level, the student must seek approval from the college director of graduate studies. Students should always check with their advisors before enrolling in a course a second time. Grade Changes: Grades properly issued in a course by the faculty member of record will not be altered except when an error was made in computation or reporting or as a result of a formal grade appeal. A grade other than "I" or "IP" may not be changed as a result of additional work after a grade has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar. The Grade Appeals procedure is described below. Credit by Examination In cases where the student has knowledge, but has not taken the appropriate course, the academic units, with approval from the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies or designee, may offer graduate courses for credit by examination. Total credit-by-examination applied to a student's degree program may not exceed six (6) semester hours. The necessary form is available on-line. The following regulations govern the granting of credit by examination: A student enrolled in a degree program (full-time or part-time) who is in good academic standing may make application to take an examination for credit. The student must follow these steps to obtain credit by examination:Fill out the top of the form and obtain the signatures of the major advisor, department chair, and college director of graduate studies. Pay the fee and attach the receipt to the form. Take the form to the department chair, who will sign it after the exam has been taken and a satisfactory grade earned. When the department chair returns the completed form to the Graduate School, the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies or designee will authorize the posting of the credit to the student's record. The form of the examination, the method of administering it, and the time of examination are left to the discretion of colleges and academic units. To receive credit, the student's examination grade should be equivalent to at least a "B" (3.0). Credit is indicated on the student's record as "S" but is not figured in the GPA. For additional information about credit by examination procedures, contact the Graduate School Academic Advisor at mstout@memphis.edu or the Graduate School Office. Course Validation The University sets time limits on students to ensure that they have reasonably current knowledge in those courses that comprise the graduate program and for which a graduate degree is awarded. When coursework taken at the University of Memphis is too old to be included in a graduate program, the academic unit may allow the student to validate that coursework by examination, subject to the following regulations: The necessary form is available online.Only students fully admitted to graduate programs and who are in good standing are eligible. Not more than 12 hours of the total credits in a master's program may be validated. Not more than one-third of the total credits in a doctoral program may be validated. Only courses with fixed content are eligible for validation. (Independent study, research, special topics courses, and workshops are ineligible.) Only those courses still being taught are eligible for validation. The student must follow these steps to validate a course by examination: Catalog--Academic Regulations--Part 12:15:24 PM]Fill out the top of the form and obtain the signatures of the major advisor, department chair, and college director of graduate studies. Pay the fee and attach the receipt to the form. Take the form to the department chair, who will sign it after the exam has been taken and a satisfactory grade earned. When the department chair returns the completed form to the Graduate School, the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies or designee will authorize the posting of the credit to the student's record.The form of the examination, the method of administering it, and the time of examination are left to the discretion of colleges and academic units. To receive credit, the student's validation grade should be equivalent to at least a "B" (3.0). Credit is indicated on the student's record as "S" but is not figured in the GPA. For additional information about course validation procedures, contact the Graduate School Academic Advisor at mstout@memphis.edu or the Graduate School Office. Transfer Credit Credit towards a graduate degree does not transfer automatically. In general, however, graduate work completed at another institution in a program accredited at the graduate level may be accepted in a graduate degree program at the University, with the following provisions. (1) These courses have not been used to earn a previous degree. (2) They relate to the content of the graduate program and/or are comparable to those offered at the University. (3) They do not exceed time limitations set for master's and doctoral programs. Credit previously earned at another institution must be presented for evaluation no later than the end of the student's second semester of enrollment. Forms are available on-line or from the Graduate School Academic Advisor at mstout@memphis.edu. Only transcripts received directly from an issuing institution are considered official. Approved transfer credit may be accepted for not more than 12 semester hours of course credit toward a master's or EdS degree. Individual academic units may set more stringent limitations. Credit will be transferred to apply toward a doctoral program upon approval of the student's advisory committee; however, the last thirty semester hours of credit for the doctoral degree must be earned at the University of Memphis. Only the number of dissertation hours accepted by the program toward the degree will be accepted as part of the last 30 hours. Courses proposed for transfer credit must meet the following two requirements. (1) The Tennessee Board of Regents requires a minimum of 750 contact minutes for each semester credit (2250 for a 3-hour course). (2) The Tennessee Conference of Graduate Schools requires a minimum of 3 hours of class work per week for 3 hours of credit. Grades earned at another institution will not be computed in the University cumulative grade point average, nor will they be accepted for transfer, unless they are "B" (3.0) or better. No credit will be transferred unless it meets with the approval of the major advisor or program graduate coordinator. Academic Misconduct Graduate students at the University of Memphis are expected to observe the regulations and policies that govern the behavior of students as members of this academic community. These regulations and policies are published in the Student Handbook. In particular, graduate students should become familiar with the University's policies on plagiarism in its various forms. Furthermore, term papers may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one course unless approved in advance by both instructors. The University of Memphis Code of Student Conduct defines academic misconduct as all acts of cheating, plagiarism, forgery, and falsification. Catalog--Academic Regulations--Part 12:15:24 PM] Using any unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes or tests Using sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers, preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments Acquiring tests or other academic material before such material is revealed or distributed by the instructor independent effort Failing to abide by the instructions of the proctor concerning test-taking procedures or evaluation Any forgery, alteration, unauthorized possession, or misuse of University documents published or unpublished work of another person without full or clear acknowledgement. It also includes the unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials. Academic misconduct also includes furnishing false information to a University official, faculty member, or office; or the forgery, alteration, or misuse of any University document, record, or instrument of identification.The Academic Discipline Committee, a standing University committee appointed by the President, addresses allegations of academic misconduct. Academic Probation A graduate student whose cumulative grade point average drops below 3.00 will be placed on probation. A second consecutive semester on probation can result in suspension. Conditions under which continuation in the Graduate School beyond two consecutive semesters on probation will be granted must be recommended by the academic unit and approved by the director of graduate studies in the student's college and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. If, in the opinion of the director of graduate studies, the academic unit, and the Graduate School, the student is not making satisfactory progress toward degree completion, the student will be dismissed from the degree program. Graduate Faculty The University of Memphis maintains five levels of graduate faculty: full, associate, affiliate, adjunct, and teaching adjunct. Only full graduate faculty members may chair doctoral committees. Full or associate graduate faculty may chair master's committees. Full members of the Graduate Faculty may direct dissertations and associate members may direct theses in an academic unit other than their own at the discretion of the graduate coordinator and/or the chair of that department. Affiliate or adjunct graduate faculty may be members of doctoral and master's committees in their areas of expertise, but may not chair them. In extraordinary circumstances, a qualified scholar from another institution may apply for Graduate committee. Teaching adjuncts may not serve on graduate committees. Membership in the Graduate faculty is required to teach 6000 level courses or above. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools requires that faculty teaching graduate and post- baccalaureate course work have an earned doctorate/terminal degree in the teaching discipline or a related discipline. All graduate coordinators should be members of the Graduate Faculty. Additional information pertaining to application for graduate faculty status, including the Guidelines and Procedures for Graduate Faculty Status, is available on-line or can be obtained from the Graduate School. Catalog--Academic Regulations--Part 12:15:24 PM]Regulatory Issues Human Subjects: All University of Memphis faculty, staff, or students who propose to engage in any research activity involving the use of human subjects must have prior approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is responsible for safeguarding rights and welfare of all persons participating in research projects, whether funded or non-funded. Human subjects means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) identifiable private information. Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.

If a student feels that individual circumstances warrant an appeal, the request for appeal must be filed in the University office responsible for the administration of that policy or the office specified in the policy statement. NOTES: 1) "Class days" excludes Saturday, Sunday, and holidays. 2) The summer sessions are considered as one term for grade appeal purposes; i.e., the period for appealing is 30 class days from the end of the last summer term. Grade Appeals This appeal procedure provides any graduate student at The University of Memphis with a clearly defined avenue for appealing the assignment of a course grade that the student believes was based on prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or some other reason not related to academic performance. Inall cases the complaining student shall have the burden of proof with respect to the allegations in the complaint and in the request for a hearing. The student must institute the appeal process within thirty (30) class days following the University deadline for posting grades in the system. If the instructor, chair, or dean fails to respond to the student's complaint procedure is terminated if the student and the instructor agree on the grade. If neither the student nor the instructor appeals a decision within the appropriate time limit, the disposition of the complaint made in the previous step shall be final. A written record of all decisions shall be kept with the file at all steps in the process. Copies of all correspondence and records shall be retained in the office in which the complaint is finally resolved. The original documents shall be forwarded to the Graduate School for filing. All parties must carefully adhere to the following procedure, observing the deadlines. Step 1 Time Limitation: Early enough to meet the deadline in Step 2. The student shall first consult with the instructor in an effort to provide a satisfactory resolution of the complaint. In the event the student cannot schedule a meeting with the instructor, the student may contact the department chair, who shall schedule the meeting between the student and the instructor. If for any reason the instructor is not available, proceed to Step 2. If agreement is reached between the student and instructor the appeal process ends. Step 2 Time Limitation: Thirty (30) class days from the University deadline for posting grades in the system. If the complaint is not resolved in Step 1, the student must complete a Graduate Grade Appeal Form (available in PDF format on the Graduate School's homepage, in the departmental office, or in the Graduate School). This form, accompanied by a written statement detailing the factual basis of the complaint along with the instructor's written rebuttal, shall be taken by the student to the chair of the department in which the course was taken. The written complaint must be received by the chair within thirty (30) class days Catalog--Appeals 12:15:25 PM]from the University deadline for posting grades in the system. The department chair shall then address the complaint in consultation with the instructor and the student within fifteen (15) class days of the date of submission of the written complaint. If the instructor is unavailable, the chair should proceed with the appeal. The department chair may utilize any resources available to resolve the grade conflict. The chair must provide a written rationale for any decision made, which shall become part of the file. If the department chair was the instructor of the course involved in the complaint, or if for any reason the chair disqualifies him/herself, the student may proceed to Step 3. The chair is empowered to change the grade if he/she finds that the original grade was based on prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or some other reason not related to academic performance. The chair shall notify both the student and the instructor in writing of the action taken. Either the student or the instructor may appeal the chair's decision within five (5) class days by filing a written request for a hearing before the dean of the college. Step 3 Time limitation: Within five (5) class days after the fifteen class-day period above. If the complaint cannot be resolved at the level of Step 2 within the prescribed fifteen (15) class days, the student or the instructor has five (5) class days to request in writing (with a copy to the Graduate School) that the chair forward the complaint to the dean of the college. The chair shall provide the dean with the Graduate Grade Appeal Form, the chair's written rebuttal, a copy of all correspondence and decisions, along with other records pertaining to the complaint. The dean may utilize any resources available to resolve the grade conflict within fifteen (15) class days. If the dean finds that the request lacks merit, he or she shall notify the student, the instructor, and the chair in writing; the grade shall remain as recorded. The dean is empowered to change the grade if he/she finds that the original grade was based on prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or some other reason not related to academic performance. Otherwise the grade shall remain as recorded. The dean must provide a written rationale for any decision made, which shall become part of the file. Either the student or the instructor may appeal the dean's decision within five (5) class days by filing a written request for a hearing before the Graduate Grade Appeals Committee with the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies or designee. This request must be accompanied by the Graduate Grade Appeal Form, a copy of all correspondence, including the dean's written recommendation, and other records pertaining to the complaint. Step 4 Time limitation: Within five (5) class days after the fifteen (15) class-day period above. The written request for a hearing before the Graduate Grade Appeals Committee should state the factual basis for the appeal of the results of Step 3. All supporting documents, including the Graduate Grade Appeal Form, should be included at the time of submission. The Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies shall forward the request to the chair of the Graduate Grade Appeals Committee. The chair shall subsequently distribute copies of the request to the members of the committee for consideration. If the Committee finds the student's or the instructor's request merits a hearing, the Committee shall notify the student, the instructor, the chair, and the college dean of the date, time, and the location of the hearing. If the Committee finds that the request does not merit a hearing, the student, the instructor, the chair, and the dean shall be so notified in writing. The Graduate Grade Appeals Committee may utilize any available resources to resolve the conflict within fifteen (15) class days. To hold a hearing, the seven (7) members of the committee (or appropriate alternates) must be present.

Comprehensive Examination Before being recommended for graduation, every candidate for the master's degree who does not write a thesis is required to pass a final comprehensive examination. Many programs also require a comprehensive examination for those students writing a thesis. Some professional programs require a culminating experience instead of a comprehensive examination. Please see specific program requirements. Some programs give the comprehensive examination within a short time period during or near the last semester of coursework or after all coursework is completed. In some professional programs the comprehensive examination is given during the calendar year in which the student expects to graduate. Other programs give a series of exams over several semesters. In all cases, comprehensive exams should be completed late Untitled 12:15:30 PM]enough in the student's program to ensure full coverage of content areas represented by required coursework. In programs that do not require comprehensive examination for thesis writers, the thesis defense will include broad questions covering the breadth of coursework as well as the thesis content. Comprehensive examinations are administered only to students in good standing and may be oral, written, or both. The result of the exam (positive or negative) must be communicated to the Graduate School on the Comprehensive Results Form within the same semester the exam was taken or by the specified deadline in the Graduate Bulletin. Protocols and procedures for administration of comprehensive examinations can be obtained at the departmental level. It is the student's responsibility to confer with the appropriate academic department regarding the time and place of the examination. A student who does not perform satisfactorily on the first comprehensive examination will be given an opportunity to take a second examination at the next regularly scheduled examination period. For serial examinations, given over several semesters, see the specific program repeat policies. The academic unit may recommend appropriate coursework, which the student will take in preparation for retaking the exam. Results of comprehensive examinations are not graded in the way that courses are and so can not be appealed, nor can they be changed after the form has been filed with the Graduate School . A second failure results in termination, which can be appealed. The retention appeals process is formalized and must be followed in all cases. See the section on "Retention Appeals." Admission to Candidacy Before an applicant will be officially admitted to candidacy for a master's degree, the student must have satisfied the following requirements: 1. The "Application for Admission to Candidacy" for the Master's Degree and an "Intent to Graduate Card" must be filed by the deadline published in the Graduate Bulletin, posted on academic unit bulletin boards on campus, and available on-line. No exceptions will be made if both the intent card and candidacy forms are not submitted by the stated deadlines. 2. If a student is writing a thesis, an approved Thesis/Dissertation Proposal Form must be filed with all necessary human or animal subjects approvals before any research is undertaken. See the section on "Regulatory Issues." 3. The student must have at least a 3.0 average on all coursework listed on the candidacy form as well as any other graduate work undertaken at The University of Memphis within the specified time limit. Grades of "D" or "F" are not accepted for any graduate degree credit but these grades will be computed in the GPA. No more than seven (7) hours of "C+," "C," or "C-" will be counted toward degree requirements. 4. Grades earned in the final semester may not be used to correct GPA deficiencies. The student must have at least a 3.0 average in all graduate work at the time the Intent to Graduate Card is filed. 5. The program must include a minimum of 70% of the total required hours as 7000 level courses. 6. All requirements of the Graduate School , the student's college, and the academic unit must be met. 7. If a student wishes to substitute a course for a required course, the substitution must be approved by the student's advisor or the program coordinator on the Course Substitution Form. The form must accompany the candidacy form. 8. The student's graduate work up to this point must be acceptable in quality and quantity to the major advisor, unit head and/or director of graduate studies in the student's college, and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. It is the responsibility of each graduate student to notify the Graduate School Academic Advisor at mstout@memphis.edu of any changes in name or address. Students who are graduating will receive a postcard from the Commencement Office regarding graduation ceremony requirements 6 to 8 weeks prior to graduation. Enrollment Requirements Untitled 12:15:30 PM]Students must be enrolled during the semester in which they defend the thesis as well as the semester in which they intend to graduate, regardless of when the comprehensive exam was taken or the culminating experience was finished and approved. Individual colleges and departments may require enrollment during the semester in which comprehensive exams are taken; check with your program for details. Thesis Requirements Most academic units provide students both a thesis and a non-thesis option (see department descriptions). A thesis of 3 to 6 semester hours may be presented as partial completion of degree requirements. Students must enroll for thesis credit each academic semester until the thesis is completed, regardless of how many hours the program will accept. Students electing to write a thesis should familiarize themselves with the Thesis/Dissertation Preparation Guide at before starting to write. An approved Thesis/Dissertation Proposal Form must be filed with any necessary human or animal subjects approvals before any research is undertaken. See the section on "Regulatory Issues" for more information. Defense of the Thesis Upon completion of the thesis, the student must successfully complete an oral defense administered by the student's advisory committee and the results reported to the Graduate School . All committee members must be present at the examination and the results are determined by a unanimous vote of the committee. Only one adjunct or affiliate graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member on a master's committee. Students must be enrolled in the semester during which they defend the thesis. If the oral exam encompasses both the comprehensive and the defense, the results should be reported separately on the forms provided. In this case, the thesis defense will include broad questions covering the extent of coursework as well as the thesis content. The final draft of the thesis must be approved by all members of the student's committee and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies for final acceptance. A copy of that final draft along with an original committee approval page must be submitted to the Graduate School after the successful defense. The Graduate School requires three copies of the master's thesis. The thesis must be accompanied by an abstract of not more than 150 words. The student should consult with the unit head and/or thesis advisor as to the number of additional copies required. Continuous Enrollment The continuous enrollment policy applies to thesis, capstone projects, and all other culminating experiences. Most programs require at least one culminating experience course; see specific program requirements for details. A student must be enrolled for at least 1 hour each Fall and Spring semester until the thesis or project is complete. A student must be enrolled in the Summer semester if the thesis will be completed then. Failure to so register will result in the student being charged tuition for each semester he or she did not enroll. The only exception to this policy is if the student's major professor is on leave or otherwise unavailable. In such cases the approval of the appropriate college director and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies is required. In case of serious medical circumstances, students may request a leave of absence, subject to the approval of the program graduate coordinator, the college director of graduate studies, and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. Retroactive approval will not be granted. A leave of absence does not extend time limit to degree. Thesis Credit Credit will be posted upon completion and acceptance of the thesis. No more than six (6) hours will be allowed for a master's thesis, even though the student may have been required to register for additional Untitled 12:15:30 PM]hours in order to maintain continuous enrollment. If a student elects not to complete the thesis, a retroactive drop (or withdrawal) must be processed for the last term of enrollment in thesis credit to reflect the change of program on the student's transcript. Second Master's Degree Students who hold a master's degree from The University of Memphis may pursue a second master's degree with a different major or degree if the academic unit accepts them. No more than six (6) semester hours of the first degree may be applied toward the second degree (see exceptions in the MFA in Creative Writing, MFA in Art, MFA in Theatre, and the MCRP).The second academic unit will determine whether any credit from the former degree will be accepted toward the second degree. Any credit accepted toward the second degree must be within the regular time limit requirements for the second master's degree. Two degrees may be pursued simultaneously or sequentially. Education Specialist The Education Specialist degree is designed for the educator-practitioner who desires post-master's training but who does not wish to earn a doctorate.

All course work must be completed within ten (10) years of the student's original admission to a doctoral program. The student may take a further two years of dissertation credit. However, individual academic units may have more stringent time limitations.There are no exceptions to program time limitations. However, students may request the option of validating old courses taken at The University of Memphis as described in the "Academic Regulations" section of this Bulletin. Grades earned in courses at The University of Memphis older than program time limits will be shown on the transcript but will not be included in the computation of the GPA for graduation purposes. Residency Requirement The student must commit to full-time study for a minimum of two successive semesters after admission to the degree program to fulfill the residency requirement. Some academic units do not count the summer Untitled 12:15:30 PM]term towards residency. The College of Education has an alternative residency program; refer to the appropriate section of this Bulletin or contact the College for additional information. Advisory Committee After admission to the doctoral program, the student will be assigned a major advisor, who must be a full member of the Graduate Faculty, to chair the student's Advisory Committee. This committee will work closely with the student to formulate an approved program of study. The program head, following consultation with the student and major advisor, will approve the appointment of a minimum of three members to the Advisory Committee. Only one adjunct or affiliate graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member on an advisory committee. These appointments will be forwarded to the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. The advisory committee is not necessarily, but may be, the same as the dissertation committee (see below). Qualifying Examination Individuals seeking a doctoral degree may be required to take a qualifying examination administered by the academic unit in which the student wishes to major. The examination may cover specialized and general knowledge of the major area as well as writing skill. The results of the qualifying exam should be used, in part, to plan the academic program. To be eligible to take this qualifying examination, the student must be fully admitted to the Graduate School . Academic units may hold additional requirements. Comprehensive Examination When a student in good standing has completed all basic required coursework for the doctoral degree or is enrolled in the last semester of coursework (exclusive of dissertation hours), he/she must pass a comprehensive examination. This examination must contain both written and oral components, covering the major and collateral fields of study. Performance must be acceptable to the Advisory Committee (not more than one dissenting vote is allowed). The result of the exam (positive or negative) must be communicated to the Graduate School on the Comprehensive Results Form within the same semester the exam was taken or by the specified deadline in the Graduate Bulletin. Protocols and procedures for administration of comprehensive examinations can be obtained at the departmental level. The comprehensive examination is not a course; therefore the results of the examination can not be appealed, nor can they be changed after the form has been filed with the Graduate School . Students may take the examination a second time, however. A second failure results in termination, which can be appealed. The retention appeals process is formalized and must be followed in all cases. See the section on Retention Appeals. A student may register for dissertation hours only after passing the comprehensive examination, submitting the results to the Graduate School , and submitting an approved "Application for Admission to Doctoral Candidacy" to the Graduate School . Dissertation Committee The student will select a dissertation committee (minimum of four members) made up of graduate faculty approved by the head of the academic unit and/or the college director. The chair of the dissertation committee must hold full graduate faculty status. It is strongly recommended that one member be outside the discipline. Only one affiliate or adjunct graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member of a dissertation committee. If the dissertation committee differs from the advisory committee, a new committee form must be filed with the Graduate School . Admission to Candidacy Before an applicant will be officially admitted to candidacy for a doctoral degree and allowed to register for dissertation hours, the student must have satisfied the following requirements: Untitled 12:15:30 PM]1. The "Application for Admission to Doctoral Candidacy" must be submitted to the Graduate School as soon as possible after the student has passed the comprehensive examination. 2. An approved Thesis/Dissertation Proposal Form must be filed with the Graduate School . Any necessary human or animal subjects approvals must be included before any research is undertaken. See the section on "Regulatory Issues." 3. The student must have at least a 3.0 average on all coursework listed on the candidacy form as well as any other graduate work undertaken at The University of Memphis within the specified time limit (10 years). Grades of "D" or "F" are not accepted for any graduate degree credit but these grades will be computed in the GPA. No more than seven (7) hours of "C+," "C," or "C-" will be counted toward degree requirements. 4. No more than fifteen (15) hours of 6000-level courses may be applied to a doctoral degree. Individual units may have more restrictive requirements. 5. Grades earned on courses taken during the student's final semester may not be used to correct GPA deficiencies. The student must have at least a 3.0 average in all graduate work at the time the Candidacy form is filed. 1. All coursework offered for the doctoral degree must have been completed within 10 years. 2. If a student wishes to substitute a course for a required course, the substitution must be approved by the student's advisor or the graduate program coordinator on the Course Substitution Form. The form must accompany the candidacy form. DissertationAn acceptable dissertation is a requirement for all doctoral degrees. The dissertation must represent a significant scholarly effort that culminates in an original contribution to the field of inquiry. It should reflect the candidate's ability to conduct independent research and interpret in a logical manner the facts and phenomena revealed by the research. The dissertation proposal (or prospectus) is developed under the guidance of the dissertation committee. All members of the dissertation committee must approve the proposal (prospectus) and the approved form must be filed with the Graduate School . If human or animal subjects are involved, the appropriate approval forms must accompany the approved Thesis/Dissertation Proposal form. Approval from the institutional review board must be secured before undertaking any research. See the section on "Regulatory Issues." The dissertation must meet the specific regulations of the academic unit in which the student is majoring and the Graduate School . Consult the academic unit for the acceptable format. Students should also familiarize themselves with the Thesis/Dissertation Preparation Guide before starting to write. The final draft must be approved by all members of the dissertation committee and by the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. This final draft of the dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School after the defense along with an original committee approval page. A minimum of three copies of the dissertation must be submitted for binding. The dissertation, which will be microfilmed, must be accompanied by an unnumbered abstract of not more than 350 words. The abstract will be published. Fees to cover the cost of microfilming and publishing are specified in Section 6, under "Miscellaneous Fees," and are to be paid by the student. Continuous Enrollment Doctoral candidates must register for dissertation credit each academic semester (fall and spring) until the dissertation is completed. A student must enroll in the summer semester if they plan to complete and defend their dissertation. See individual academic units for specific requirements. Failure to so register will result in the student being charged tuition for each semester he or she did not enroll. The only exception to this policy is if the student's major professor is on leave or otherwise unavailable. In Untitled 12:15:30 PM]such cases the approval of the appropriate college director and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies is required. In case of serious medical circumstances, students may request a leave of absence, subject to the approval of the program graduate coordinator, the college director of graduate studies, and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. Retroactive approval will not be granted. A leave of absence does not extend time limit to the degree. Defense of Dissertation After the completion of the dissertation and all other prescribed work for the degree, candidates will be given a final oral examination dealing with the dissertation and its relation to the candidate's major field of study. The student's dissertation advisory committee will conduct this exam. All members must be present at the examination. If the student's performance on this examination is satisfactory as judged unanimously by the committee, all requirements for the degree will have been completed. Students must be enrolled in the semester during which they defend the dissertation. Dissertation Credit Credit will be posted upon the completion and acceptance of the dissertation. No more than the maximum number of semester hours for dissertation accepted by the academic unit will be counted towards the degree, even though the student may have registered for additional hours in order to maintain continuous enrollment.Graduation To be certified for graduation, the student's entire program, including the dissertation, must be acceptable to the dissertation committee, unit head and/or director of graduate studies in the student's college, and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. The following paper work, in addition to Comprehensive Examination Results and Admission to Candidacy forms (filed before enrolling for dissertation hours), must be filed in the Graduate School by the stated deadline: 1. An "Intent to Graduate Card," by the deadline published in the Graduate Bulletin, posted on academic unit bulletin boards, and available on-line. No exceptions will be made if the Intent to Graduate Card is not submitted by the stated deadlines. 2. The Dissertation Defense Results form, as soon as the defense has concluded. It is the responsibility of each graduate student to notify the Graduate School Academic Advisor at mstout@memphis.edu of any changes in name or address. Students who are graduating will receive a postcard explaining graduation ceremony requirements 6 to 8 weeks prior to graduation. Second Doctoral Degree Students who hold or are pursuing a doctoral degree from the University of Memphis may pursue a second doctoral degree with a different major or degree if the academic unit accepts them. Students pursuing two doctoral degrees must seek prior approval from each major professor and doctoral committee before being considered a doctoral candidate. No more than 12 semester hours from one doctoral degree may be applied toward the other degree. The second academic unit will determine whether any credit from the former degree will be accepted toward the second degree. Any credit accepted toward the second degree must be within the regular time limit requirements for the doctoral degree. Students must pass separate comprehensive examinations and successfully defend separate dissertations. Two degrees may be pursued simultaneously or sequentially.

Most of these students go on to teaching positions on the secondary and community college level; a smaller number enter government service at all levels; and some secure specialized positions in business, industry, and journalism. Those students preparing for teaching on the university level or related careers in research and writing should look upon the MA program as preparation for advanced graduate study. They are thus strongly urged to fulfill the requirements of the MA program by the preparation of a thesis. A. Program Prerequisites The student is required to have a minimum of 18 semester hours in undergraduate history with a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4-point scale in all undergraduate history courses. In special cases an exception may be made with the approval of the Graduate Coordinator in History. The department will normally consider for admission only students with a GRE verbal score of at least 450 and quantitative and analytical scores acceptable to the department, or an MAT score of at least 45. In unusual circumstances we may admit a promising student who does not fully meet all of the requirements . B. Program Requirements 1. A total of 33 hours for the student who elects not to write a thesis. 2. A total of 30 hours for the student who elects to write a thesis, with 6 hours of credit being assigned to the thesis. 3. No more than 9 hours may be taken at the 6000 level. 4. HIST 7000, a HIST 7070 seminar, and at least 12 hours for students writing a thesis (this includes 6 hours of 7996 thesis credit) or 15 hours (for non-thesis students) of other 7000-level courses. Only 3 of these hours can be History 7012, although 6 hours may be accepted in special circumstances by petition to the Graduate Coordinator. All students who do not write an MA thesis are required to complete at least one additional 7070 seminar in their 15-hour requirement. The following courses do not count toward the degree: HIST 7020, 7021, 7022, and 7990. Department of 12:15:41 PM]5. and the Coordinator of Graduate Studies. Under special circumstances students may petition for up to an additional 6 hours. 6. No more than 21 hours may be taken in United States History, European History, or any one field of history, such as Ancient History. 7. A comprehensive examination over course work given by a committee chosen by the Graduate Advisor and the student. 8. Thesis approval by a department committee headed by the faculty member who directed the preparation of the thesis. NOTE: Students electing to write a thesis should familiarize themselves with the Thesis/Dissertation Preparation Guide before starting to write. C. Concentration in Ancient Egyptian History (Note: area. It does not imply that this is our only area of specialization.) Beyond the core requirements, students choosing this concentration must take twelve (12) hours (if writing a thesis) or eighteen (18) hours (if not writing a thesis) of MA level courses with a focus on ancient Egypt. Students will also take two semesters of basic Middle Egyptian (ARTH 7115 and 7116, which are required but will not count toward the degree), plus two more semesters of readings from ancient Middle Egyptian texts.III. PhD Degree Program The Department of History also offers a program of study built upon the MA degree leading to the PhD degree. The program is designed to provide wide knowledge in two fields, more intensive preparation in a third field, and professional competence in original research and writing that will prepare the student for teaching and research in higher education or for a career in government, business, library service, and other research-related fields. A. Program Admission The Graduate Studies Committee normally evaluates applicants for the Ph.D. program once each year, in March, for admission in the Fall semester. However, we will also consider the application of promising students at other times, but February 15 is the deadline by which we must receive all the application materials of anyone who wishes to be considered for an assistantship. We will consider applications according to the following criteria: 1. A minimum of 24 graduate hours in history with at least a 3.25 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) from an accredited institution. An MA in history is strongly recommended. 2. GRE verbal score of at least 500, with a quantitative and analytical score acceptable to the department.3. anticipated fields of study, and general research interests. In this statement, the candidate will be 4. Three letters of recommendation. All application materials will be considered by the Graduate Studies Committee, with input invited from considered automatically for a graduate assistantship at this time. Admission decisions will be made by April 1. Limited departmental resources may require that the department restrict the number of new candidates admitted to the program. B. Advising Students admitted into the PhD program in history will be advised by the Coordinator of Graduate Studies when they first enroll. During the first semester enrolled each student will choose an advisory committee to be composed of a major professor with full graduate faculty rank and at least two other faculty members. This committee assists the student in determining such matters as fields of study, the choice of courses, Department of 12:15:41 PM] will be in writing with copies to the student and to the Graduate Coordinator.

With the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee, one field may be taken in another department or may be interdisciplinary, including courses from at least three departments (two in the case of Egyptology).8. No course may be used to fulfill the requirement for more than one field. 9. Upon approval of a petition to the Graduate Studies Committee from both the student and a prospective dissertation director, a dissertation may be completed in a field that is not normally a dissertation field. E. Concentration in Ancient Egyptian History (Note: area. It does not imply that this is our only area of specialization.) Department of 12:15:41 PM]Students choosing this concentration will take at least 12 hours of courses in the dissertation field of Ancience History that focus on ancient Egyptian history.

The following courses do not count toward the degree: HIST 7/8020, 7/8021, 7/8022, and 7/8990 (except as describedc above in D.1.c). G. Comprehensive Examination No sooner than the last semester of course work, and after satisfying the language requirement and other foregoing requirements, the student will take a Comprehensive Examination over all fields. The examination approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The Comprehensive Committee should be composed of at least one faculty member from each minor field and two faculty members from the dissertation field. On the written part of the examination, eight hours will be allotted to the dissertation field and four hours to each of the minor fields. After a student has taken all parts of the comprehensive exam, the Comprehensive Committee will conduct an oral examination over all the fields, normally within two weeks, but if necessary the Comprehensive Committee may extend the time. After the oral exam, the committee will either pass the student or require the retaking of one or more written parts. If the student is required to retake one or more parts of the written exam, the committee may choose to hold another oral examination, but it is not required to do so. The student may not retake required parts of the examination sooner than one full semester after the first attempt. After the student has retaken all required parts, including a second oral examination, if required, the Comprehensive Committee will decide whether, with the approval of at least three of the four members, the student should be promoted to late doctoral status or dropped from the program. Upon successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the coordinator of graduate studies will notify the Graduate the comprehensive examination. H. Dissertation To complete the requirements for the PhD in History, the student must prepare a dissertation based on a substantial amount of original research and submitted in the acceptable form. The dissertation topic will be determined by the student in consultation with a faculty member in the dissertation field who agrees to direct the research. NOTE: Students electing to write a dissertation should familiarize themselves with the Department of 12:15:41 PM]Thesis/Dissertation Preparation Guide before starting to write. Each PhD student shall, within one semester after passing the comprehensive examination, present a prospectus of the proposed dissertation in a colloquy attended by the Dissertation Committee, which consists of at least four graduate faculty, chaired by the director, who, with at least two other members, must have full graduate faculty status. It is recommended that one member be outside the discipline, department, or university. Prospective committee members not on the University of Memphis faculty must apply for Adjunct Gradaute Faculty status. The departmental requirement that three of the required four members hold Full Graduate Faculty membership (including the director) may be waived by the Graduate Coordinator when an Adjunct/Affiliate member's credentials warrant it. In these instances, only two of the departmental faculty members will be required to hold full Graduate Faculty membership. Only one adjunct or affiliate graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member. All history faculty and graduate students shall be invited to this colloquy, and all other interested persons shall be welcome.This is not intended as an examination, but rather as an information forum in which the candidate can discuss ideas and receive suggestions and criticisms. Within a reasonable period after the colloquy, the student shall present a revised prospectus in written form to the Dissertation Committee and the Graduate Studies Committee for approval. Formal approval of the final dissertation will be given by the Dissertation Committee and the Graduate Studies Committee. HISTORY (HIST) 6020. Internship in History. (1-12).

GRAESSER, PhD Chair KATHERINE KITZMANN, PhD Associate Chair, Coordinator of Graduate Studies E-mail: admissions@mail.psyc.memphis.edu . The Department of Psychology offers PhD programs in Clinical Psychology, Experimental Psychology, and School Psychology, an MA (terminal, non-thesis) program in School Psychology, and an MS (either thesis or non-thesis) program in General Psychology. Students admitted to one of the PhD programs complete the requirements for the MS in General Psychology (with thesis) as part of their PhD requirements. An EdS degree with a major in Education and a concentration in School Psychology is also available (offered collaboratively with the College of Education). In addition, the MS in General Psychology program may be entered as a terminal program. Admission to each graduate program in Psychology is handled separately. Each has its own admission criteria, and application must be made for a particular program before an applicant is considered for that program. Any person admitted to one of these programs who desires to transfer to another program within the department must make formal application to that program and will be evaluated competitively against the same criteria and on the same time schedule as all other applicants for that program. The departmental objective is to educate both experimentally sophisticated professional psychologists and professionally appreciative research psychologists. The department professes a strong research emphasis, with a very diverse array of theoretical models and frames of reference. Awarding a degree does not merely attest to the accumulation of the specified number of hours in the classroom but also to the acquisition of sophisticated professional and research skills. The faculty has the responsibility to both the public and the profession of psychology to award a degree only when the student has achieved a satisfactory level of professional and research competencies as judged by the graduate faculty of the department. Further, students must exhibit high integrity and moral character consistent with the standards of ethical principles set forth by the American Psychological Association. For all of the following graduate programs, admission is not automatic by meeting minimal departmental admission requirements. Students are selected from a pool of qualified applicants to each program. Each year the number of students admitted to a program depends on availability of financial aid and adequate faculty supervision. Once admitted, students in these programs can obtain further details about Psychology Department procedures by reading the Graduate Programs Handbook. II. MS/PhD Degree Program There are three broad programs within the MS/PhD degree program: Clinical Psychology (APA approved), School Psychology, and Experimental Psychology. In additional to these doctoral programs, faculty and students participate in six research areas: Behavioral Medicine, Behavioral Neuroscience, Child and Family Studies, Cognitive Psychology, Industrial-Organizational Psychology, and Psychopathology and Psychotherapy. Students interested in other areas should contact the department for further information. In these programs the MS is preparatory to continuation in the program. In order to be advanced to doctoral study, a student must have satisfactorily completed all requirements for the MS (including a thesis that is empirical and psychological) at The University of Memphis, or have completed an equivalent degree complete a thesis before being advanced to doctoral study. Department of 12:15:45 PM]Program objectives are: (1) understanding of theoretical principles and practices of psychology; (2) development of expertise in experimental design, data analysis, and oral and written presentation of research results; and (3) competitive for professional positions in psychology. A. Program Admission and Prerequisites Applicants to the MS/PhD degree program are evaluated once each year only, for admission in the Fall semester; applicants for Spring admission are not considered.

A graduate student whose cumulative grade point average in sociology drops below 3.00 will be placed on departmental review. A second consecutive semester on departmental review will result in suspension. Conditions under which continuation in the program beyond two consecutive semesters on departmental review will be granted must be recommended by the department's graduate committee and the department chair. If, in the opinion of the graduate committee and the chair, the student is not making satisfactory progress toward degree completion, the student will be dismissed from the degree program. Students are ineligible for graduate assistantships while on departmental review, but may apply/reapply for an assistantship once their departmental review status has been removed. f. According to Graduate School policy, students must complete the requirements to remove a grade of "I" (incomplete) within 90 days from the end of the semester or summer term in which it was received or the "I" changes to an "F." If unusual circumstances prevent the student from The Department of 12:15:46 PM]removing the "I" within 90 days, a 45-day extension may be granted. It is the student's responsibility to request an extension. The department will allow students who received a grade of "I" that changes to an "F" to submit a written request to the graduate committee for a grade change. The request must be made after the student has completed requirements for the course in which the "F" was received and must spell out the reasons why the student was unable to complete the requirements for the course prior to the "I" becoming an "F." In addition, the request must be made within one year of the beginning of the semester or term in which the student enrolled in the course. If the faculty member from which the student received the "I" and the graduate committee agree that extraordinary circumstances prevented the student from completing requirements for the course before the "I" changed to an "F," they will recommend to the department chair that the student's "F" be changed. If the chair agrees with the recommendation of the faculty member and the graduate committee, the chair will recommend to the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies that the student's grade be changed.

Residency Students working toward the doctoral degree must fulfill the University and College residency requirement after filing a program of studies. PurposeThe purpose of residency is to provide the doctoral student with significant time for sustained contact with faculty members. An expected outcome is the acquisition of skills of inquiry, an opportunity for research, and the incorporation of professional values into the experience that the student brings to graduate school. Also, it facilitates the creation of a cohesive climate in which inquiry becomes the linking feature of the graduate student experience. In short, residency is expected to be a vehicle for socialization into the shared community of professional life. At the heart of that community lies a commitment to sustained inquiry that practitioner or as one who demonstrates leadership based on a foundation of inquiry. Doctoral Residency Policies 1. A doctoral student must select one of the following course enrollment options: The student will maintain two semesters of continuous enrollment of 9 hours per semester. The enrollment requirement may be satisfied by enrolling in fall, spring, and summer semesters. Three semesters of continuous enrollment of 6 hours per semester; Nine hours of enrollment per semester during two consecutive summers and at least 3 hours per semester during the intervening fall and spring semesters. 2. A plan for the scholarly product of residency will be developed by the student and major professor. The plan will be reviewed by the department. 3. The scholarly product plan of residency consists of the following elements: The plan will be contained in a 3-5 page document. It will contain an introduction to the problem area that the student will address during the coming period of residency. This introduction will include a specification of the problem, an indication of its importance, and a brief summary of pertinent literature placing the problem in its context. Relevant theoretical implications will be noted. It will detail a plan of action including projected time benchmarks to resolve the problem. It is expected that this plan will allow for a sustained and multifaceted inquiry that incorporates significant components derived from the literature and that have implications for the field of study. Tools of inquiry expected to be required in the course of completing the residency will be noted. If the candidate possesses these tools, some indication documenting the mastery of the tool component should be noted. If skills of inquiry are to be acquired during the course of the residency this must be noted.Faculty resources associated with each component of the plan must be indicated. It is expected that the student will be in contact with individuals who have been engaged in this area beyond the campus.The products of the residency will be noted. It is expected that the residency will lead to a paper submitted to a refereed journal or a peer reviewed conference. A copy of the scholarly product of residency that has been approved by the major advisor must be filed with the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. All research involving data collection, use of existing data, or other investigations using human subjects must be reviewed and approved by the University's Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects prior to beginning any such research. The College of 12:16:01 PM]Timetable for Filing for Residency Prior to beginning residency, the written plan must be filed. The plan must have the approval signatures of graduate registration in the semester designated to count as residency. Students are expected to have satisfied requirements for admission to the doctoral program before filing a residency plan. Comprehensive Examination for the EdS, EdD, and PhD Degrees When the candidate in good standing has completed all course requirements for the EdS, EdD, or PhD degree or is enrolled in the last semester of coursework (exclusive of culminating experience or dissertation) he/she must pass a comprehensive exam, written and oral, covering the major and collateral fields of study. For EdD and PhD candidates, residency must be completed prior to taking the comprehensive exams. The student who passes the comprehensive exam will be designated as a Late not enroll in dissertation hours until they have attained Late Doctoral status. EDS CULMINATING EXPERIENCE AND DOCTORAL DISSERTATION The EdS degree candidate will present a six-hour culminating experience appropriate to the major area of specialization. This may be fulfilled through a thesis based on research related to the major, a field study of a significant problem, an organized internship, or a special project appropriate to the major. An acceptable dissertation is a requirement for all doctoral degrees. The dissertation must embody the ability to conduct independent research and interpret in a logical manner the facts and phenomena revealed by the research. The student will be required to meet the specific regulations of the major department and of the Graduate School (see the Thesis/Dissertation Preparation Guide ). The EdD or PhD degree candidate Enrollment Requirements All degree candidates must maintain continuous enrollment of at least one credit hour per semester (Summer school enrollment is optional for continuous enrollment.) once they begin taking field study, culminating experience, or dissertation hours. If they fail to do so, they will be charged retroactive tuition at graduation. Students must be enrolled for at least 3 credit hours in the semester in which they defend. Credit will be posted upon the completion and acceptance of the culminating experience or dissertation, but no more than 6 hours will be counted toward degree requirements for an EdS culminating experience and no more than 12 hours for a doctoral dissertation. This requirement may be waived for any semester the advisor is not on campus or for other reasons approved by the major advisor, the department chair, and the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies of the College of Education. Failure to remain in continuous enrollment without an approved waiver will result in reevaluation of the Committee Membership for Supervision of the Dissertation After completing the comprehensive examination, the candidate will form a dissertation advisory committee of at least four graduate faculty members. The dissertation advisory committee will direct the development consultation with the candidate and the major advisor, will make a recommendation to the Associate Dean The College of 12:16:01 PM]for Graduate Studies concerning the appointment of the dissertation advisory committee. Doctoral Prospectus In order to provide a relatively uniform framework for preparation of a doctoral prospectus, the College of Education has specified a format to be followed in its preparation. Copies of the format may be obtained from the major advisor or from the office of the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. Once a prospectus is approved, it is expected that the study will be completed within three years; if not, "Early doctoral student" designation applies to all doctoral candidates from the time of formal admission to candidacy in the College of Education until the time of completion of course work and passing the comprehensive exam. At that time the candidate is redesignated as "late doctoral student." Culminating Experience/Dissertation Guidelines Culminating experiences and dissertations must be prepared according to guidelines specified by the College and the Graduate School. For specific information, the student should consult his/her major advisor. NOTE: Students should familiarize themselves with the Thesis/Dissertation Preparation Guide before starting to write. Final Examination (Culminating Experience/Dissertation Defense) After the completion of the culminating experience/dissertation and all other prescribed work for the degree, all candidates will be given a final oral examination dealing primarily with the culminating GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPS Active work and satisfactory progress toward a degree are necessary to hold an assistantship, and graduate assistants are required to be registered in each term in which they hold assistantships. Full-time graduate assistants take twelve hours of course work per semester (six hours if they are enrolled for thesis or dissertation hours) and serve 20 hours per week on the assistantships. Permission for graduate assistants to take fewer then twelve credit hours in a semester may be granted by Studies and the department chair. Permission to take more than twelve hours may be granted upon recommendation of the department chair and the College of Education Associate Dean for Graduate Studies.Introduction | Academic Services | Admissions Regulations | Academic Regulations Minimum Degree Requirements | Appeals Procedures | Degree Programs & Courses | Expenses Graduate Assistantships & Fellowships | Research Facilities | Residency Classification University Administrators | University Calendar | Graduate School | U of M Home Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology & 12:16:03 PM]COUNSELING, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY, AND RESEARCH Room 100, Ball Hall (901) 678-2841 DOUGLAS C.

The Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology, and Research offers graduate degree programs in three program areas: MS and EdD degrees in Counseling and Personnel Services, MS and PhD degrees in Educational Psychology and Research, and a PhD degree in Counseling Psychology. Admission to each of these programs is handled separately. Each has its own admission criteria, and application must be made for a particular program before an applicant is considered for that program. Any person admitted to one of these programs who desires to transfer to another program within the department must make formal application to that program and will be evaluated competitively against the same criteria and on the same time schedule as all other applicants for that program. The time to degree completion for the EdD degree in Counseling and Personnel Services, the PhD degree in Educational Psychology and Research, and the PhD degree in Counseling Psychology is limited to 10 years, an exception to the general Graduate School policy. The departmental objective is to prepare advanced educational leaders to be both sophisticated practitioners and researchers. Programs in Counseling and Personnel Service and Counseling Psychology have a strong scientist- practitioner base. Programs in Educational Psychology and Research have a strong research emphasis. The graduate degrees within the department will qualify students as university and college teachers, counselors, psychologists, program evaluators, and researchers in educational and counseling environments, as well as provide them with the skills necessary to fill a variety of roles in other settings in which knowledge of human development, learning and cognition, research and evaluation methods is essential. Program objectives are: (1) comprehension of concepts and theories underlying the profession of counseling; (2) ability to collect, analyze, and interpret individual and group data, and to generate and test hypothesis related to human behavior; (3) ability to effectively counsel in both individual and group settings: (4) ability to formulate, implement, and evaluate appropriate counseling programs and interventions; (5) ability to understand and demonstrate ethical behavior and the legal and ethical implications of that behavior; and (6) development of sensitivity and understanding of the needs of persons who are culturally different, including the ability to (a) examine attitudes and myths regarding the culturally different and (b) the sociopolitical forces impacting the culturally different client. All graduate students within the department will demonstrate generalized competency in core areas of psychological inquiry. Generalized competency may be demonstrated either by passing examinations or completing designated coursework in three of the four general domains: 1. Research methods and data analysis 2. Measurement and evaluation 3. Human development 4. Learning and cognition II.
