Combinatorics and graph theory have been active research areas in the Department of Mathematical Sciences since the early 1970's. When Paul Erd&#337s, the most famous combinatorialist of the twentieth century, learned that the Ramsey number for any pair of cycles had been determined by the Memphis group, he immediately expressed an interest in visiting the Mathematics department and working with members of this group. During the 23 year period of the Erd&#337s visits to Memphis, approximately 50 different papers were written with him and faculty in the department. Erd&#337s 2014 Poster The 2014 Erd&#337s Lecturer An important component of the Lecture Series is the Erd&#337;s Lecture given by an internationally renowned scholar who has made important contributions in graph theory and combinatorics. The Erd&#337;s Lecture this year will be given by Fields Medalist, Enrico Bombieri. "Recent progress on Prime Numbers and Sieves" Enrico Bombieri (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton) Abstract: The theory of prime numbers has seen very recently memorable progress with the astonishing solution of the problem of existence of infinitely many prime pairs with bounded gap, obtained independently by Yitang Zhang and James Maynard. This lecture will give a bit of the history of the problem, a description of the progress in obtaining better and better sieving tools and a quick outline of new ideas in the works by Zhang and Maynard.
