Video Communication Requirement The Higher and Adult Education program now requires students taking online courses to be able to communicate with faculty by means of video and audio conferencing technology. In many cases your computer may already have this capacity (with a built - in video camera and microphone). A computer headset is also required to avoid audio feedback issues in group Web conferences (Do not use your internal or external PC speakers). There are an abundance of web cameras and headsets with mic rophone s on the market making the cost very reasonable. UMmeet Video conferencing allows students and faculty to interact a virtual face - to - face meeting. Video conferences may also be used for team projects and other student assignments. The HIAD program has been issued a license for UMmeet web conferencing. UMmeet integration is left to the individual faculty member s discretion . If your instructor elects to use web conferencing, a computer test must be run p rior to your fi rst online meeting with UMm eet.
