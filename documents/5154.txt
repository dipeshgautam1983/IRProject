School of Communication Sciences and Disorders About Programs People Research Student Organizations Resources News Home School of Communication Sciences and Disorders Helping people communicate. Have you ever wondered what it would be like not to be able to communicate your thoughts, feelings, or ideas? Communication is something many of us take for granted, but for the millions of individuals who have difficulty hearing, or those who have trouble speaking because they stutter or they have had a stroke, communication is not so simple. The University of Memphis School of Communication Sciences and Disorders is nationally recognized for its academic, research, and clinical education programs for educating future audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and speech, language, or hearing scientists interested in helping individuals with such communication disorders. The School offers a graduate-only curriculum leading to the AuD degree with a major in Audiology, the MA degree with a major in Speech-Language Pathology and the PhD degree with a major in Communication Sciences and Disorders with concentrations in Hearing Sciences and Disorders or Speech-Language Sciences and Disorders. The School has been consistently ranked among the best graduate programs by U.S. News and World Report every year since 1998. *** SLP Clinical Faculty Position Available *** We are offering an introductory course in American Sign Language at the Undergraduate level this Fall!
