The previously named Athletics Building will reopen as the Wellness, Health &amp; Fitness Building (WHFB) with over 90,000 square feet of recreation, classroom and meeting space available. The improved facilities promise to bring new vitality to the Lambuth community. Constructed in 1970 in a Georgian Colonial style, the WHFB anchors the western side of the U of M Lambuth quadrangle.  Recent improvements have included safety, aesthetic, access and service quality upgrades. Planned future renovations include the conversion of outdated athletic locker rooms to classroom space. The WHFB will allow for the continued expansion of academic, recreation and intramural opportunities at the U of M Lambuth campus.  The 1,500 seat basketball court and auxiliary multi-purpose gym will host Health &amp; Human Sciences classes as well as competitive,  recreational and intramural basketball, volleyball and dodge ball games.  Campus Recreation and Intramural Services will administer a survey this fall to  explore other desired recreational activities, including the possibility of club sports.  The 25 yard, 6 lane pool is designed for recreational and competitive swimming and will host classes such as beginning and intermediate swim, water aerobics and lifeguarding.  Adjacent men’s and women’s locker rooms will be available. The newly refreshed basketball court at the WHFB on the Lambuth Campus looks great! The WHFB complements the current Fitness Studio located on the first floor of the Wilder Union, which contains free weights, weight machines, treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bicycles, and mat space for stretching and exercises.  Outdoor recreational facilities are located south of the WHFB and include sand volleyball, tennis courts and open field space that will host additional intramural activities such as ultimate Frisbee and the “Punt, Pass &amp; Kick” football event. The WHFB will serve all aspects of wellness, health and fitness.  In addition to recreation and intramurals, the WHFB houses four modern classrooms which will serve academic areas that include Nursing and Health and Human Sciences.  Counseling services will relocate to the WHFB in the future, and Student Health services are also planned for the space. The WHFB is an exciting new resource for the U of M Lambuth community, and one that will support dynamic academic and co-curricular opportunities and wellness services.  We will celebrate the addition of this facility with an open house for students, faculty, staff, community members and alumni this fall.
