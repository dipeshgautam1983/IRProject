UofM Students Contact Us UofM Students Employment Opportunities Field Experience Home Lipman UofM Students Employment Opportunities Employment Opportunities For Teaching Staff Lipman School staff are employees of the University of Memphis. All hiring for regular positions will be advertised on the University's Web site. The University's guidelines for hiring will be followed. For further information or job postings, please refer to the University's Human Resources web site . For Graduate Assistants Because we are the lab school for the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences, we seek graduate assistants who preferably are education majors. However, graduate students who are studying in other related fields are considered. We also require that our graduate assistants have some experience working with young children. Assistantships at the Lipman School are teaching assistants in the classrooms, working directly with the supervising teacher. Benefits of an assistantship include tuition and a monthly stipend for nine months. An assistantship at a university laboratory school is a very positive addition to a professional resume. Inquire directly to the school. For Student Workers We are very interested in employing work study students and student workers who are either education majors or have previous experience working with young children in an organized setting such as a child care center. *Please note that all employees are required by state law to have a background check provided by the University. All graduate assistants and student workers must participate in a semi-annual, in-service training scheduled prior to the beginning of each semester.
