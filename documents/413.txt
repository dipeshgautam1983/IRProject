Course Objectives By participating in this course you will come to recognize the pervasiveness and importance of negotiation. You will acquire a new repertoire of negotiating skills. You will develop a systematic and pos itive approach to negotiating with colleagues, bosses, clients, other stakeholders, and external groups of all kinds in ways that equip you to deal also with all kinds of conditions and circumstances. This course aims to help you develop the negotiating s kills needed to meet the challenges facing negotiation. First, it will help you develop the sophistication to analyze bargaining and conflict relationships and to l earn (through class discussion and self - assessment) about your own individual bargaining style. 2 Second, this course uses various techniques to help you understand ...the basic elements of negotiation; ...when to reach a deal and when to walk away; ...ho w to negotiate in teams; ...how to negoti ate with multiple opponents; ...how to ha ndle international negotiations; ... have a basic understanding of the various truths and non - truths of negotiation, and ...your personal negotiation style and how to improve it. Course Approach The course will be conducted in a lecture discussio n format supplemented with exercises and be assigned a role in each negot iation exercise. Multiple negotiations will take place in different sections of the classroom. My role during the exercises is to play moderator, observer and tour guide. Students will also make Negotiation Truths presentations throughout the semester. Giv en the experiential nature of the course, y our class participat ion is expected since it is a critical part of the course. No laptops or cell phones during class. If you take class notes on your laptop, please let me know. Tests Multiple - choice question s will be used to test your knowledge of all lecture and textbook materials associated with the cours e. Three exams worth 100 points each will be given throughout the semester. All 3 exams are mandatory . There is no provision to drop any of the exams. On ly if you miss an exam because of a University approved excuse, you must take the final exam . This exam is comprehensive covering the entire course and will be taken during the regularly scheduled final exam period. Truth Presentation Students will mak e a Power point presentation to the class about the assigned individual numbered Truth topic s from the text: Truth about Negotiations . The presentation is worth 50 points. Please use your creativeness and initiative to explain the topic (s) including any re lated topics incorporating any examples, either per sonal or from outside sources. Please submit a copy of your power point sides along with a list of outside sources used prior to class presentation. Gradin g will be based on the Truth about Negotiations Presentation Evaluation Criteria. 3 Negotiation Exercises Each student will be required to participate in 5 negotiation exercises . First, students can try out their negotiation skills in a friendly environment that will encourage personal growth. Secon d, these presentations can serve as mini - cases for real - world negotiation situations in which many of the concepts from class can be applied. ALL students are requir ed to attend each negotiation exercise as they are the foundati on for your individual journ als and a major portion of your course grade. J ournals During the course, each student is expected to maintain a journal describing his/her role experiences and reflecting on learning experiences as a negotiator during the 5 experiential exercises. Keep ing a journal encourages reflection on and analysis of the learning - by - experience simulations of negotiation we conduct in class. Your comments also give me a sense of your individual progress, as well as some insight into your strengths and weaknesses as a negotiator. Your task is to describe your reactions, perceptions, impressions, or significant insights gained from participation in (or reflection on) the simulations. Examples of some of the types of points I encourage you to address include the followi ng: a. what you expected in the situation; b. how you prepared for the negotiation; c. how you and others in the group behaved; d. what you learned about your skills; and e. what you would do differently the next time around. Your journal will be d ue the class period after the experiential exercise. Each journal submission is worth 50 points. We will conduct 5 experiential exercises in class. You are required to complete a journal on 4 of the 5 exercises. More specif ic criteria for your journals wil l follow in a separate handout.
