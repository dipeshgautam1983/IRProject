Bi ology Biology is the study of living things what they are, how they work, how they interact, and how they change over time. A B . S . degree in Biology provides an excellent foundation from which to pursue graduate or professional study or post - graduate employment. What do students in Biology study? Once you have completed the foundation courses, you can explore a diversity of topics in the biological sciences. These topics include such areas as cell and molecular biology, microbiology, genet ics, physiology, evolution, plant biology, and ecology. Any of these areas can be studied in depth in over 70 courses covering such subjects as biochemistry, vertebrate anatomy, immunology, ornithology, wetland ecology, mammalogy, developmental biology, b otany, and animal behavior. Furthermore, the department emphasizes hands - on research experiences as a critical component of the undergraduate curriculum. What have our students done with their Biology degrees? You will find our recent graduates in medic al, pharmacy, dental, and allied health schools across the country. Many are teaching in universities or high schools, or work as environmental educators in public or private interpretive programs. Others are pursuing research careers at universities, re search institutions, or in industry. Several graduates are employed as field or laboratory biologists for federal, state, and local governmental agencies. Still others work in biomedical businesses and law, regulation, or policy. What other opportunitie s does the Department of Biological Sciences offer? Involvement in specialized research and teaching activities through the Integrated Microscopy Center, Meeman Biological Station, Ecological Research Center, W. Harry Feinstone Center for Genomic Researc h, and Gulf Coast Marine Laboratory One - on - one mentoring while participating in active biological research programs that can lead to professional publications and presentations Participation in extended field studies inside and outside the United States Ex posure to national and international research and researchers through the BIOLOG Y COURSE S BIOL 1010.

Program in Biology This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Science in Biology during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin p lanning to enter the Accelerated B.S./M.S. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Biological Sciences. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.S. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.S. Please consult the Undergraduate Catalog for further information. Biology Minor Comp letion of 18 semester hours in BIOL courses including BIOL 1110/1111, BIOL 1120/1121 and 10 upper division hours.
