system (LLI) implemented in Tift County Schools (TCS) in Georgia and the Enlarged City School District of Middletown (ECSDM) in New York during the 2009 - 20 10 school year. Developed by Fountas & Pinnell (2009) and published by Heinemann, LLI is a short - term, small - group, supplemental literacy intervention system designed for students in kindergarten through second grade (K - 2) who struggle with literacy . The goal of LLI is to provide intensive support to help these early learners quickly achieve grade - level competency. Both school districts evaluated in this study adopted the targeted, small - group implementation model of LLI in their schools with support from Heinemann consultants providing LLI professional development. This report focuses on the implementation and impact of this model during the first full school year of the system in these schools. Research Questions The purpose of this study was threefold : (1) to determine the efficacy of the Leveled Literacy Intervention system (LLI) in increasing reading achievement for K - 2 students; (2) to examine the implementat ion fidelity of LLI ; and (3) to determine perceptions of the LLI system according to relevant stakeholders . This study focused on two U.S. school districts and comprised 427 K - 2 students who were matched demographically and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. This evaluation used a mixed - method s design to address the following key research questions: 1. What progress in literacy do students who receive LLI make compared to students who receive only regular classroom literacy instruction? 2. Was 3. LLI Participants Five elementary schools in TCS in Tifton, GA, and four elementary schools in ECSDM in Middletown, NY , volunteered to participate in the study. 1 TCS is a rural school district located approximately 181 miles south of Atlanta, GA, that served 7, 551 students during the 2008 - 2009 school year. Most of the schools in TCS are small and serve primarily White and African American populations Twenty - one K - 2 teachers train ed in LLI and 209 K - 2 students eligible for LLI in TCS participated in this study. ECSDM is a suburban school district located approximately 72 miles northwest of New York City, NY, that served 6,764 students during the 2008 - 2009 school year. The size of the schools in ECSDM ranges from 435 to 2,048 students . This district serves primarily Hispanic and African American populations (46 .0 % and 27 .0 % , respectively ), with more than half of students (64.0%) identified as 1 Georgia and New York were chosen because both states have a fairly extensive literacy assessment system. acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 2 w York Department of Education. Seven K - 2 teachers trained in LLI and 218 K - 2 students eligible for LLI in ECSDM participated in this study. Methods The present study of the LLI system employed a randomized control led trial , mixed - methods design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative data and allows students to be randomly selected for the treatment (i.e., LLI in the first semester) or control (i.e., LLI in the second semester , if needed ) condition. A matched - pair design was also utilized to ensure equivalen cy between treatment and control groups , and pre - post comparison s of stu dent achievement in literacy were conducted . In addition, assessment s of fidelity of LLI implementation included both independent observations and feedback from teachers and independent on - site researcher s, and yielded both observational and self - reported survey data. Multiple instruments were utilized in the evaluation, including two measures of reading LLI instructional practices; and two teacher surveys and focus groups to obtain - site LLI . Procedure The current study extended from March 2009 thr ough June 2010. In the spring of 2009, three CREP researchers were responsible for ensuring that the districts understood and agreed to participate in the study while implementing LLI as intended by the developers. CREP researchers provided on - site orien tation to the project and trained school coordinators and on - site researchers in each district to assist with data collection. At the beginning of the 2009 - 2010 school year, each district provided CREP with a list of first and second grade students that t hey had identified as eligible for LLI using their own selection criteria and whose parents had provided consent to participate in the study. Pre - testing of these students with the LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS began during the first three weeks of school. S ubsequently, CREP conducted the randomization of the matched pairs of first and second graders based on demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, ELL status, special education status, and free/reduced lunch status) and pre - test LLI benchmark sc ores of instructional reading level. Students in the treatment group were then placed in LLI groups by LLI teachers, and the planned 90 days of LLI instruction for first and second graders began. Control group students did not receive LLI until the first and second grade evaluation period ended, and neither treatment nor control students received any additional pull - out literacy interventions during the study period. Once at the beginning of the study period and once at the end, on - site researchers used the LLIOT to conduct random observations of each first and second grade LLI group. Post - tests with the LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS for the first and second grade students were completed at the conclusion of LLI in February for TCS and March for ECSDM . The LLI teachers and first and second grade classroom teachers with students in the study also completed an online survey regarding LLI literacy program, as applicable, at this time. After CREP researchers conducted mid - year follow - up vi sits in each district, the entire procedure was repeated for kindergarten students, who began LLI in February (TCS) and April (ECSDM) and concluded in May (TCS) and June (ECSDM). Finally, CREP researchers visited each district at the end of the school yea r to address any remaining issues related to the study and to conduct structured focus groups with LLI teachers and on - site researchers. acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 3 Results Student Achievement: Fountas & Pinnell LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS Kindergarten LLI Benchmarks On average after 38 days of LLI instruction, k indergartners who received LLI achieved a mean gain of 1.56 benchmark levels as compared to 0.78 benchmark levels for kindergartners who did not receive LLI. Also, kindergartners in LLI started, on average, below grade l evel in benchmark testing (i.e., pre - A = 0) but finished at a level between A and B, whereas their counterparts in the control group started near pre - A and finished around Level A. Thus, kindergartners in LLI finished the school year close to grade level in literacy ( i . e ., end - of - year kindergarten grade level goal = Level C ). Also of note, English Language Learner (ELL), African American, and Hispanic students in LLI exceeded those in the control group. ELL students in LLI achieved a mean gain of about 1 ½ benchmark level s (M = 1.55 ) compared to a ½ benchmark level (M = 0.50) for ELL students not in LLI. African American LLI students also gained about 1 ½ benchmark levels (M = 1.44) while those in the control group only gained less than a benchmark level (M = 0.7 9 ). Finally, Hispanic students in LLI made the most gains almost 2 benchmark levels (M = 1.76) versus their counterparts in the control group who gained less than a benchmark level ( M = 0.70). Also, all three subgroups finished closer to grade l evel (i.e., Level C ) than their counterparts who finished around Level A or below. Kindergarten DIBELS Overall, fewer significant gains were seen with the DIBELS outcomes. However, kindergartners in LLI significantly exceeded those who were not in LLI o n nonsense word fluency (NWF) (M = 10.64% and M = 6.88%, respectively). Also, for phoneme segmentation fluency (PSF) , ELL students in the treatment group (M = 46.72%) outperformed ELL students in the control group (M = 23. 96 %), as well as non - ELL students in both the treatment and control groups (M = 23. 24 % and 24.24%, respectively). Thus, kindergartners who participated in LLI showed more significant gains on subtests of the DIBELS as compared to those who did not have LLI. 1 st Grade LLI Benchmarks On a verage after 73 days of LLI instruction, 1 st graders who received LLI achieved a mean gain of 4.46 benchmark levels as compared to 2.63 benchmark levels for 1 st graders who did not receive LLI. Also, 1 st graders in LLI generally started below grade level in benchmark testing (i.e., A = 1) but finished at a level between E and F, whereas their counterparts in the control group started near Level A and finished around Level D. Thus, 1 st graders in LLI finished their LLI sessions at the grade level mid - year goal in literacy ( i . e ., mid - year grade level goal for 1 st grade = Level s E/F) , while the control group students were still slightly behind. Also of note, African American and Hispanic students in LLI exceeded those in the control group. African American LLI students made the most gains they gained about 5 ½ benchmark levels (M = 5.20) while those in the control group only gained about 2 ½ benchmark levels (M = 2.60). Finally, Hispanic students in LLI also made significant gains about 4 benchmark levels ( M = 4.18) versus their counterparts in the control group who gained about 2 ½ benchmark levels (M = 2.57). Also, both subgroups finished at the grade level goal (i.e., Level E/F) compared to their counterparts in the control group who finished close to Le vel D. Of importance to note, the finding for African American 1 st graders in LLI appears particularly robust and educationally significant. These LLI students finished the highest out of all subgroups as well as the aggregate close to Level G versus all others who finished between Level s C to F. acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 4 1 st grade DIBELS Overall, similar significant differences between treatment and control groups were seen with the 1 st grade DIBELS outcomes. 1 st graders in LLI significantly exceeded those who were not in LLI on nonsense word fluen cy (NWF) (M = 22.00% and M = 17.0 0%, respectively). Also, for NWF, Hispanic students in the treatment group (M = 19. 0 0%) outperformed their counterparts in the control group (M = 17. 0 0%). Additionally , 1 st graders who received LLI performed better than their counterparts on Oral Reading Fluency (ORF) (M = 1 4 . 0 0% and M = 11. 0 0% , respectively), as well as on Letter Naming Fluency (LNF) (M = 17. 0 0% and M = 11. 0 0% , respectively). Thus, 1 st graders who particip ated in LLI showed more significant gains on subtests of the DIBELS as compared to those who did not have LLI. 2 nd G rade LLI Benchmarks On average after 73 days of LLI instruction, 2 nd graders who received LLI achieved a mean gain of 4.64 benchmark levels as compared to 2.99 benchmark levels for 2 nd graders who did not receive LLI. Also, 2 nd graders in LLI started, on average, below grade level in benchmark testing (i.e., E = 5) but finished at Level J, whereas their counterparts in the control group star ted closer to Level F but only finished around Level I. Thus, 2 nd graders in LLI finished the school year close to the grade level mid - year goal in literacy ( i . e ., mid - year grade level goal for 2 nd grade = Level J/K). Also of note, a robust overall effec t was found for students with a special education designation who received LLI. These students in the treatment group started around Level C and finished close to Level H , while their counterparts in the control group started at Level D and finished aroun d Level F. Also, regarding ethnicity subgroups, White students in LLI finished above their counterparts in the control group, gaining about 5 benchmark levels (M = 5.05) compared to about 3 benchmark levels (M = 3.14) in the control group. Additionally, African American and Hispanic students in LLI exceeded their counterparts in the control group. Of particular educational significance, African American LLI students finished at the highest level compared to all other s just above Level I; however, this was closely followed by the Hispanic LLI students who also finished slightly above Level I on average. The African American students in the treatment group gained about 4 ½ benchmark levels (M = 4.46) , while those in th e control group only gained about 2 ½ benchmark levels (M = 2.67). Finally, Hispanic students in LLI gained more than African American students in LLI (M = 4.53 and M = 4.46 , respectively) , while Hispanic students in the control group only gained about 3 benchmark levels. 2 nd G rade DIBELS Overall, no significant differences were found between treatment and control groups for 2 nd grade on either DIBELS subtest that was administered as intended for 2 nd graders (i.e., Nonsense W ord F luency and Oral Reading F luency). While unexpected, this result may simply indicate that the 2 nd grade DIBELS measures were not sufficiently in alignment with the 2 nd grade LLI curriculum or benchmarks to detect small effects, or changes, in DIBELS scores. However, it is also plausible that the lack of an overall effect may be due to district - level differences in these scores. One district appears to have made significant gains on the 2 nd grade DIBELS tests compared to the other, but taken together, no overall effects were abl e to be seen (i.e., a wash - out effect from averaging acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 5 Observations: Leveled Literacy Observation Tool (LLIOT) The results from the LLIOT revealed that 5 of the 10 LLI lesson components were rated across both districts. The highest rated lesson components (i.e., those demonstrating the highest degree of implementation fidelity) included phonics/word work, reading a new boo k , and rereading . The lowest rated lesson components (i.e., those demonstrating the lowest degree of implementation fidelity) included classroom and home connections. Teachers were also rated highly on their use of literacy instructional strategies, such as modeling and encouraging fluent oral reading and appropriate reading strategies and assisting students in problem - solving . Further, in the majority of observed lessons, instructional m aterials were readily available; the lesson was well - organize d; and students were engaged and attentive. Additionally, the majority of observed groups had 3 students and lasted approximately 30 minutes, which was consistent with design. Overall, observers perceived that the lesson was delivered as designed 96. 3% of the time. The LLIOT was conducted at both the beginning and the end of LLI for each of the observed groups in order to measure changes in implementation over time. For the 25 observed kindergarten groups, there were no significant differences on any of the 3 LLIOT subscales (Quality of LLI Implementation, Literacy Instructional Strategies, and Learning Environment) from the first observation to the second. For both the 25 observed first grade groups and the 33 observed second grade groups, only s cores on the Learning Environment subscale improved significantly from pre - test to post - test. For time points. Teacher Surveys: LLITQ & CTLIQ Overal l, on the Leveled Literacy Intervention Teacher Questionnaire (LLITQ), LLI teachers were most likely to agree that they understood the goals and implementation procedures for LLI, that LLI positively impacts student literacy achievement, and that their dis tricts and other teachers within their schools were supportive of LLI. LLI teachers also reported a positive impact of LLI on their reading instruction, particularly their understanding of the role of comprehension and phonics/phonemic awareness in the re ading process and the relationship of leveled texts to successful reading. LLI teachers were least likely to agree that the parents of their LLI students participated in home literacy activities with their children, that their schools had sufficient facul ty and staff to provide LLI to all students who needed it, and that LLI helped their students with special needs and ELL students. All of the surveyed teachers agreed that their school should continue using the LLI system . In terms of the regular clas sroom literacy instruction provided to both treatment and control students in the study, results from the Classroom Teacher Literacy Instruction Questionnaire (CTLIQ) revealed that the K - 2 classroom teachers were most likely to provide individual or small - group reading instruction, integrate vocabulary and comprehension into their literacy instruction, and utilize high - quality literature to read to students and engage them in interactive discussions about the text. Teachers were least likely to report util izing whole - class reading instruction and assigning home literacy activities for students to complete with parents. Overall, the classroom teachers were most likely to agree that they understood the goals of their literacy program, that it was aligned wit h state and district reading/language arts standards, and that their faculty, staff, and administration believed that all students could learn to read and write. Similar to the LLI teachers, classroom teachers were least likely to agree that the parents o f their students participated in home literacy activities with their children, acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 6 that their schools had sufficient faculty and staff to fully implement their literacy program, and that their literacy program helped their students with special needs and ELL s tudents. The majority of surveyed teachers agreed that their school should continue their current literacy program. Focus Groups Structured focus groups conducted with the LLI teachers in the study revealed that most of the LLI teachers liked LLI and felt that it was beneficial to their students. Some teachers felt that the system needed more work, and others felt that school - level variables (e.g., support, time, materials) needed improvement in order to implement LLI correctly. LLI teachers reported that the most frequently encountered logistical issue when implementing LLI was time and/or scheduling of LLI groups to essons during the designated 30 - minute timeframe. In terms of strengths, L LI teachers most frequently identified the instructional materials, particularly the books and take - home books. LLI teachers also liked the design (e.g., group size, lesson layout, guided format of lessons). When asked about areas of improvement for LLI , LLI teachers most frequently mentioned an inability to adequately complete a lesson in 30 minutes, an inconsistency of system was too fast - paced for their lower - lev el students. LLI teachers also discussed problems with using the new online LLI Data Management System, including slowness and missing data, and recommended on - site training and additional resources for using the system. Structured focus groups were als o conducted with on - site researchers who completed the DIBELS assessments and LLIOT observations for the study. Based on their observations of LLI lessons, on - im plementation during the current study. On - site researchers were also impressed with the well - organized, adaptable nature of LLI and its ability to build student confidence. When asked about areas of improvement for LLI , on - site researchers most frequent ly mentioned the length of the Reading Records, the difficulty of completing a lesson in 30 minutes, and the fact that the system was too fast - paced for slower learners. Overall, the on - site researchers in the focus groups were positively supportive of LL I, but they did caution that the system experience and level of LLI training. Conclusions 1. What progress in literacy do students who receive LLI make compared to students who receive only regular classroom literacy instruction? Across the three grade levels, the current study found that LLI positively impacts K - 2 stu dent literacy achievement in rural and suburban settings. Further, we determined that LLI is effective with ELL students , students w ith a special education designation, and minority students in both rural and suburban settings. Finally, the current study showed that LLI is effective with economically disadvantaged children in both rural and suburban settings. This study found robust effects on the LLI Benchmarks across all grade levels for students who received LLI. Across the three grade levels, students in LLI achieved between 1 ½ benchmark levels up to almost 5 ½ benchmark levels , while students who did not receive LLI ach ieved between less than 1 benchmark level to 3 benchmark levels. acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 7 Further, these effects were particularly strong for various subgroups (e.g, ethnicity, special education or ELL status) within each grade level. For k indergarten, significant effects were found, compared to the control group, for African American students, Hispanic students, and ELL students on the LLI Benchmarks, with all three subgroups finishing closer to grade level (i.e., L evel B) than their counterparts who finished at or below L e vel A. First grade African American and Hispanic students in the treatment group also showed more gains than their counterparts in the control group. In second grade, strong, educationally meaningful effects were found for African American and Hispanic LLI students. Second grade African American LLI students finished at the highest level overall, closely followed by the Hispanic LLI stude nts . Additionally, effects found with the DIBELS measures of reading fluency provided corroboration of the results with the LLI Benchmarks. In k indergarten, students in LLI showed significant gains on subtests of the DIBELS as compared to those who did not hav e LLI. In particular , for phoneme segmentation fluency, ELL students in the treatment group outperformed ELL students in the control group, as well as non - ELL students in both the treatment and control groups. In 1 st grade, LLI students significantly exc eeded the control group on 3 of 4 subtests: nonsense word fluency, letter naming fluency, and oral reading fluency. Finally , on the nonsense word fluency subtest , 1 st grade Hispanic students in the treatment group outperformed their counterparts in the co ntrol group. Taken together, all of the student achievement results provide strong evidence that students who are eligible for and participate in LLI make significant progress in literacy compared to students who are eligible to receive LLI and only re ceive regular classroom literacy instruction. 2. Across all observations, the observation results from the current study suggest that LLI was implemented with a high degree of fidelity to design across both districts. The majority of lesson components received high fidelity ratings in most of the observations that were conducted. Additionally, observation results revealed that LLI implementation was consistent across the year, with high fidelit y scores received at both time points when the observations were conducted. Finally, days, students in all three grade levels made significant progress in th eir literacy achievement. This finding suggests that LLI can still be effective during a relatively short timeframe, which may be valuable to districts with a large number of students to serve or limited time in which to implement early literacy intervent ions. 3. LLI Overall, the LLI teachers in the current study supported LLI and believed that it had a positive LLI teachers indicated that they had a good understanding of the system ; received support in implementing LLI from their district, school adm inistration, and other school staff; and perceived a positive impact of LLI on their reading instruction. LLI teachers were particularly impressed with the leveled texts as well as the small - group format and guided lesson structure; however, many LLI teachers felt that the lessons could not be completed in 30 minutes, that the system was too fast - paced for their lower - level students, and that there were some inconsistencies in the materials. Finally, in addition to the LLI teachers, a small numbe r of classroom teachers with students in the current study provided feedback on their perceptions of the LLI system . Most of these teachers were positive about the system acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 8 literacy in the classroom improved after receiving LLI, with one classroom teacher even commenting, eve that children that struggle would give up hope in the realm of reading without the LLI Recommendations Altogether, the results from this evaluation allow us to conclude that LLI posit ively impact s These results also suggest that continued implementation of LLI would be beneficial in both T ift C ounty S chools and the E nlarged C ity S chool D istrict of M iddletown . While the long - term impacts of LLI have yet to b e determined, the positive results found in this evaluation suggest that additional benefits may be seen with the continuation of LLI. This evaluation provided a randomized controlled trial and efficacy study for the LLI system as well as offered an oppor tunity for research - based recommendations that may enhance the system , future research, and ultimately student achievement. From this evaluation, CREP proposes the following recommendations with regard to LLI and its implementation in schools: When possible, schools should begin k indergarten instruction in LLI as soon as possible in order to provide the recommended amount of instruction (i.e., 14 weeks) for kindergarten students. Professional development for building principals and central off ice supervisory staff, although not measured in this study, surfaced as being critical to the implementation. Likewise, regular classroom teacher involvement and professional development to familiarize them with LLI and its features also appears to infl uence the quality of implementation. LLI teacher professional development should be ongoing with at least a refresher training to supplement and resolve any district - specific issues. Providing scenarios or examples of how prior adopters have developed schedules that allow for full implementation of the 30 - minutes - a - day, five - days - a - week instructional pattern would be helpful to school districts who are new adopters of LLI. Suggestions and recommendations of how LLI teachers might plan and organize their LLI sessions so they can accomplish the instructional goals in a t ypical 30 - minute session would benefit prior and new adopters of LLI. Additional suggestions from the authors about how best to instruct LLI groups whose members are not at the same l evel or who have members progressing at a slower rate would be helpful. Providing some type of video for parents of the LLI students could not only explain the system but could provide clips of how they should be working with their child. This is partic ularly important for the parents of ELL children and the parents of economically disadvantaged children. A careful review of all materials and resources is recommended to ensure consistency and accuracy throughout the system . acy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 9 There is a great need to co nduct a similar study in at least one major urban district. Future research of LLI should include longitudinal tracking of student reading achievement to look at the long - term impact of LLI beyond one school year. The LLI benchmarking system would benefit from additional systematic comparisons with other nationally recognized literacy assessments. Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 10 Introduction This report summarizes evaluation results for an efficacy study of the Leveled Literacy Intervention system (LLI) implemented in Tift County Schools (TCS) in Georgia and the Enlarged City School District of Middletown (ECSD M) in New York during the 2009 - 2010 school year. Both school districts adopted the targeted, small - group implementation model of LLI in their scho ols with support from Heinemann consultants providing LLI professional development. This report focuses on the implementation and impact of this model during the first full school year of the system in these schools. Developed by authors Irene C. Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell (2009) and published by Heinemann, LLI is a short - term, small - group, supplemental literacy intervention system designed for students in kindergarten through second grade who struggle with literacy . The goal of LLI is to provide intensi ve support to help these early learners quickly achieve grade - level competency. The LLI materials are the Fountas & Pinnell Text Level Gradient TM , A - Z ( Fountas & Pinnell, 2007) . The system emphasizes systematic and explicit instruction in phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, comprehension, and the expansion of oral language skills, including vocabulary. Heinemann consultants provided professi onal development sessions for teachers regarding the LLI materials and instructional strategies. The teachers also received professional development training on the LLI online data management system, used to track student progress and attendance. The eva luation was designed to examine the extent to which participation in LLI influenced student literacy achievement and designed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of L LI according to relevant stakeholders. The work reported here was conducted by the Center for Research in Educational Policy (CREP), a S tate of Tennessee Center of Excellence, located at the University of Memphis. The Center's mission is to implement a r esearch agenda associated with educational policies and practices in preK - 12 public schools and to provide a knowledge base for use by educational practitioners and policymakers. Since 1989, the Center has served as a mechanism for mobilizing community an d university resources to address educational problems and to meet the University's commitment to primary and secondary schools. Functioning as a part of the College of Education, the Center seeks to accomplish its mission through a series of investigatio ns conducted by Center personnel, college and university faculty, and graduate students. Theoretical Framework Research suggests that children with poor early reading skills continue to struggle with reading and writing in the later grades and are more l ikely to drop out of school (Alexander, Entwisle, & Horsey, 1997; Juel, 1988; Tabors, Snow, & Dickinson, 2001). However, there is evidence that quality early intervention programs can prevent the development of long - term reading deficiencies (Heibert & Ta ylor, 1994; Wanzek & Vaughn, 2007). Previous studies by Harrison, Peterman, Grehan, Ross, Dexter, and Inan (2008) and Peterman, Grehan, Ross, Gallagher, and Dexter (2009) showed that K - 2 students enrolled in LLI made significant gains on the Gates - Mac Gin itie Reading Test, with 25 to 44% of students reading at or above average by the end of the study . The LLI system has its roots in the theoretical and empirical work of Marie Clay (1991) and of Fountas and Pinnell (1996, 2006), and its lesson design draws from empirical research on reading acquisition and reading difficulties, language learning, and student Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 11 Outcomes Measurable increases in individual literacy skills ( e.g., struggling students back on track). Other positive outcomes, e.g., increased independent reading. Factors affecting impact of LLI interventions Quality of training on LLI lesson delivery Teacher qualifications Duration of LLI Other factors (e.g., physical environment) Overall quality of LLI (e.g., ancillary materials, teacher training) Appropriate, motivating materials (leveled books) Fidelity of LLI instruction Appropriate group composition , p ositive group dynamics, etc. Other factors Other positive supports, e.g., support for literacy at home Quality of classroom instruction School - level factors (e.g. quality of support for literacy instruction) motivation (e.g., Armbruster, Lehr, & Osborn, 2001; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 200 0 a; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 200 0 b). The current study expanded on these findings by utilizing a multi - site, randomized experimental design to examine whether students in LLI achieved greater gains in literacy than students receiving classroom literacy instr uction alone. Theory of Action Figure 1, below, represents our preliminary identification of some of the key factors that impact the quality of LLI and its overall impact on student learning. Generally, the model states that measurable increases in student literacy growth and other positive outcomes will result upon completion of a certain number of intervention sessions as well as from a combination of factors, including those directly related to the intervention itself and other non - LLI factors such as the quality Figure 1 : LLI Theory of Action Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 12 LLI Factors Factors that we propose that may directly affect the quality of LLI include: teacher qualifications and progress (e.g., teachers select appropriate sequence of leveled books at the students the overall quality and fidelity of LLI instruction; composition of the student group (e.g., students at more or less the same reading level or combinations that include students with special needs and ELL students); and other factors suc h as the learning environment and the duration of the intervention. We discuss each of these factors in turn, along with how these factors may be measured. Teacher Qualifications and Training A cluster of teacher factors may affect the overall quality of LLI. For example, teachers who already have a certain level of experience and skill in delivering literacy interventions may be more likely to benefit from LLI training and more likely to make good use of the materials than teachers wh o are less experien ced. It was, therefore, important to have background information on the teachers providing the intervention including years of experience, degrees attained, and other relevant training and job experience. Finally, the professional development provided to LLI teachers, subsequent to their selection, is critical to LLI implementation. Appropriate Selection of LLI Materials T he LLI system depends heavily on the use of leveled, high - interest texts that are selected after assessing students with the Fountas & beginning instructional reading level and independent reading level . As the intervention progresses, teachers select the progress or sequence of the leveled texts that students read. Therefore, it was important to evaluate the match between the leveled texts used for instruction, at the beginning and throughout the LII intervention. It was engagement in using the materials . At a minimum, this implies a careful log of the books used along with data on each Careful observations of the interventions themselves, along with teacher surveys and logs from the LLI data management system, were ach ievement and the level of student engagement during lesson instruction. Fidelity of LLI High - fidelity implementation of LLI depends in part on the amount and quality of professional training provided , the support of school administrators , and a commitmen t from the teachers selected to be LLI interventionists. We also wanted to know how much training ha d been provided as well as the quality and relevance of the training from the teacher perspective. Relevant teacher demographics and perceptions were obtained from the participating teachers. The developers provided details about the professional development that was provided to each district. Group Composition and Behavior Since LLI is a small - group intervention, it was important to know about the i ndividual characteristics of each group. For example, if students have different needs (e.g., students can be struggling at the same instructional reading level for different reasons), it could be difficult for a teacher to provide instruction that meets the needs of the group as a whole. Also, if one student is unmotivated Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 13 or disruptive, this could presumably impact the social dynamics of the group and ultimately affect the success of the intervention. It was also important to know whether some or all o f the students in the group had been identified as students with special needs or ELL students . With this in mind, we did demographics and characteristics (i.e., literacy level). Other Intervention Factors The impact of LLI is dire ctly affected by other factors, such as the duration of the intervention. We utilize d part of the LLI data management system to obtain a record of the actual number of days of intervention for each group ( 14 weeks is recommended for kindergarten and 18 we eks is recommended for first and second grades ) . In addition, data was collected relative to adherence to the recommended 30 - minutes - a - day, 5 - days - a - week instructional cycle. Finally, we conducted structured focus groups with on - site researchers and LLI teachers to gather additional qualitative data related to instructional time, student absences and mobility, materials , and several other tangential factors. Non - LLI Factors Non - LLI factors include school - level variables, such as the overall support for literacy in the School - Level Variables A full understanding of how LLI works in a particular context and why it may be more or less successful from one school to another will be usefully informed by understanding school - level factors, such as overall support for literacy in the school (e.g., literacy may receive more emphasis and resources in some schools than in others) and school - level attention to the needs of struggling students. Certain schools, in other words, may provide con texts that tend to promote a high - quality implementation of LLI. In th e current study, we measu re d these factors through surveys of both LLI teachers and regular classroom teachers . Quality of Regular Classroom Literacy Instruction Students receiving LLI in the current study were also receiving literacy instruction from their regular classroom teacher, and some portion of any measured gains in literacy skills over the period of the study may be attributable to the quality of literacy instruction that the children received in their regular classroom. Students who are receiving high - quality literacy instruction in the classroom and high - quality intervention are more likely to show progress than students who receive the same quality of intervention but lower - quality classroom instruc tion. We use d a teacher survey regarding the intervention students received . Research Questions The purpose of this study was threefold : (1) to determine the efficacy of the Leveled Literacy Intervention system (LLI) in increasing reading achievement for K - 2 students; (2) to examine the implementation fidelity of LLI ; and (3) to determine perceptions of LLI according to relevant stakeholders . This study focus ed on two U.S. school districts and comprised 427 K - 2 students who were Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 14 matched demographically and randomly assigned to tre atment and control groups. The evaluation used a mixed - method s design to address the following key research questions: 1. What progre ss in literacy do students who receive LLI make compared to students who receive only regular classroom literacy instruction? 2. 3. LLI and its impact on their Method s The present study of the LLI system employed a randomized controlled trial, mixed - methods design, including both quantitative and qualitative data. A matched - pair design was also utilized to ensure equivalen cy between treatment and control groups, and pre - post comparison s of stu dent achievement in literacy were conducted . In addition, an assessment of fidelity of implementation , including both independent observations and feedback from teachers and independent on - site researcher s, yielded both observational and self - reported survey data. Multiple instruments were utilized in the evaluation, including two measures of reading LLI instructional practices; and two teacher surveys and focus groups to obtain - site LLI . Details of each instrument will be discussed later in this section. System Description: Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) The Leveled Literacy Intervention system (Fountas & Pinnell, 2009) is a short - term, intensive, small - group intervention designed for children in kindergarten through second grade who are having difficulty learning early reading and writing skills. The goal of the system progress in order to bring their skills up to grade level so their early literacy difficulties do not become long - term def icits. The system is appropriate for struggling regular education students and students with special needs, and there are minor modifications for English language learners (ELL students). Children enrolled in LLI meet in small groups (ideally three stude nts) for daily 30 - minute lessons, and the intervention lasts a maximum of 18 weeks, depending on the progress of the individual child. According to developers (Fountas & Pinnell, 2008), LLI emphasizes the development of oral language skills as a foundati on for reading and the five components of reading instruction identified by the National Reading Panel ( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 200 0a ): phonological awareness and phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Phonics i nstruction is systematic, explicit, and follows a prescribed sequence of sound - letter relationships and spelling patterns. Additionally, reading comprehension skills are taught through intensive interactions between the teacher and the students and amongs motivation and interest in reading and writing. An underlying premise of LLI is that children benefit from experience with texts that they can well as with more challenging texts written at (Fountas & Pinnell, 2008). The LLI system provides students with both kinds of Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 15 reading experiences, a lternating between easier texts and more challenging ones. Easier texts build fluency and give students success at reading that builds confidence and positive self - esteem. More challenging texts, which students read with scaffolding and support from the LLI teacher, give children the opportunity to develop more sophisticated readin g skills. LLI materials specify concepts that teachers can emphasize when discussing each book in the sequence. Other key ideas underlying the design of LLI are the following: Struggling children learn best when lessons follow a predictable sequence. A ll LLI lessons have the same basic structure, allowing children to focus most of their processing attention on reading, writing, phonics, and word study activities. Children who are struggling with reading and writing need to learn fast, automatic process ing of oral and written language. For this reason, LLI lessons are designed to be fast - paced, with a specified set of literacy activities for each day of the intervention. The fast pace promotes rapid processing and keeps children engaged in the lessons and motivated to participate in the literacy activities and discussion. Literacy interventions should be linked to classroom instruction and the home environment. Children take LLI books home to read aloud to their parents, along with simple homework ass ignments, and they also may take books back to the classroom. A system of ongoing formative assessments conducted during the 18 weeks gives teachers information about student learning that can inform their instructional decision - making. Literacy teachers selected to be LLI teachers receive eight days of professional development focused on how to implement the LLI instructional program. They also receive the necessary LLI materials and a detailed teaching guide. Additional professional development is pro vided throughout implementation, including training in how best to facilitate comprehension skills through teacher - student and student - student interactions. I n addition to the professional development regarding LLI materials and instructional strategies, TCS and ECSDM educators also received training on the LLI online data management system, used to track student progress and attendance. Further, for the purposes of the study, the two school districts voluntarily agreed to provide the LLI system as specif ically designed by the developers. A strict implementation plan was utilized, which included the following guidelines : No additional pull - out literacy interventions for either treatment or control students for the duration of the study The m aximum number of instructional days (i.e., each district attempted to provide 90 days of LLI instruction to first and second graders and 70 days to kindergarteners, according to the recommendations of developers) Three students per group Consistent LLI completi on across the district (i.e., all students in the study within each district would begin and end LLI at the same time) Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 16 Setting and Population of Participants Five elementary schools in T ift C ounty S chools (TCS) in Tifton, Georgia , and four elementary sch ools in the Enlarged City School District of Middletown ( ECSDM ) in Middletown, New York, volunteered to participate in the study. 2 TCS is a rural school district in a small town located approximately 181 miles south of Atlanta, G eorgia , that served 7,551 students during the 2008 - 2009 school year. Most of the schools in TCS are small and serve primarily White and African American populations (48.0% and 35.0%, respectively), with more than half of students (65.0%) identified as Twenty - one K - 2 teachers trained in LLI and 209 K - 2 students eligible for LLI in TCS participated in this study. ECSDM is a suburban school district in a small city located approximat ely 72 miles northwest of New York City, N ew Y ork , that served 6,764 students during the 2008 - 2009 school year. The size of the schools in ECSDM ranges from 435 to 2,048 students. This district serves primarily Hispanic and African American populations ( 46.0% and 27.0%, respectively), with more than half of students (64.0%) reduced lunch status. Seven K - 2 teachers trained in LLI and 218 K - 2 students eligible for LLI in ECSDM participated in this study. Table 1 summarizes the overall demographic characteristics of both districts.

According to data obtained from a survey of all participating LLI teachers, the majority of LLI teachers in the study had been teaching in their curren t school (84.1%) or any school (93.2%) for 6 or were all female, 97.7% White, and almost all held their professional teaching certification (95.5%). Addit ionally, almost all of the LLI teachers in the study (93.2%) had completed the LLI professional development. Overall, these teachers had a solid background of teaching experience at their current 2 Georgia and New York were chosen because both states have a fairly extensive literacy assessment system.

Student Demographics Across the five participating schools in TCS and the four participating schools in ECSDM , there were a total of 427 students who participated in this study . Of these students, 146 were in kindergarten, 130 were in first grade, and 151 were in second grade. A total of 222 students comprised the randomly assigned treatment group for the study, while 205 students made up the control group; the slight discrepancy in group size is attributable to student attrition that occurred after randomization participating schools , 37.0% of students in the sample were Hispanic, 33.5% were African American, and 28.5% were White.

Instrumentation Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this evaluation. CREP researchers used & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS). One observational tool, the Leveled Literacy Intervention Observation Tool (LLIOT), was used to evaluate LLI literacy practices and instructional strategies in the classroom. Two teacher surveys, the Leveled Lite racy Intervention Questionnaire (LLITQ) and the Classroom Teacher Literacy Instruction Questionnaire (CLITQ), were also used to ascertain teache LLI and classroom literacy instruction . Additionally, structured focus groups were conducted wi th LLI teachers and on - site researchers to gather additional qualitative feedback regarding LLI . Details of each instrument are discussed below. Student Lite racy Achievement Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System (LLI Benchmarks) The Fountas & Pin nell Benchmark Assessment System was used to measure the following literacy skills: phonemic awareness, letter - sound relationships (decoding), vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and writing. Both treatment and control students in the study were tested by LLI teachers at the beginning and the end of LLI . This data was used to measure individual student gains as well as the composition of the groups in respect to homogeneity of student needs. The Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System is an individ ually administered assessment tool designed by the developers of LLI to reliably place K - 2 students on the Fountas & Pinnell Text Level Gradient TM , A - Z ( Fountas & Pinnell, 2007), an A - Z gradient of text difficulty. LLI is comprised of three systems: Level s A - C are in the Orange System; Levels A - J are in the Green System; and Levels C - N are in the Blue System. The Orange System is generally used in Kindergarten; the Green System in Grade 1; and the Blue System in Grade 2. The goal of the LLI system is to bring children up to their current grade level in reading, starting from the earliest L evel A (mid - k indergarten) to Level N (early third grade). 3 3 Product description from the Heinemann LL I Field Study Request for Proposal Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 20 Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) DIBELS , developed by the Early Childhood Research Institute on Measuring Growth and Development at the University of Oregon, is a tool for early identification of children with potential literacy problems and an assessment of response to instruction. The DIBELS assessment is designed to enable educators to modify their approach if a student is not on course to achieve reading goals. The Institute reports that reliability with young children across the country. The measures were developed based upon the essential early literacy domains discussed in both the National Reading Panel ( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000 a ) and National Research Council (1998) reports to assess student development of phon ological awareness, alphabetic understanding, and automaticity and fluency with the code. DIBELS consists of seven subtests , most of which can be used for either benchmark or progress - monitoring assessments. Different subtests are administered depending on the time of year and the grade. Benchmark assessments are given to all children in a grade three times a year, while progress - monitoring assessments are used electively. Administrating each subtest should take from five to seven minutes. The seven DI BELS subtests 4 are: Initial Sound Fluency ( Pre - K indergarten through Mid - Kindergarten ) This subtest measures the Letter Naming Fluency (Kindergarten through Beginning of Grade 1 ) This subtest asks students to name as many letters, both uppercase and lowercase randomly mixed, as they can in one minute. Ph oneme Segmentation Fluency (Mid - Kindergarten through Grade 1) This subtest is a direct measure of phon eme awareness. Students are asked to say the individual sounds that make up a word or syllable containing three or four phonemes. Nonsense Word Fluency ( Mid - Kindergarten through Beginning of Grade 2) This subtest tters with sounds and use that knowledge to decode three - letter syllables that alone are nonsense words. Oral Reading Fluency (Mid - Grade 1 through Grade 3 ) This subtest includes benchmark passages at each grade level that are used to measure accuracy and speed in reading graded passages. Oral Retelling Fluency (Mid - Grade 1 t hr o ugh Grade 3) This optional assessment asks the student to tell as much as they can about a passage that they are asked to read. Word Use Fluency ( Pre - Kindergarten through Grade 3) This optional subtest is designed to assess vocabulary knowledge and expressive language for students in each grade level. 4 Information is obtained from University of Oregon Center on Teaching and Learning online resource at Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 21 To streamline the assessment process for the purposes of the study, only the first five subtests we re administered. The subtests were administered in an identical manner at both pre - test and post - test. To ensure the identifying and coding of reading variables occu r r ed in a n accurate manner for the purposes of the study , the on - site researchers used to conduct the DIBELS assessments receive d formal from CREP researchers . On - site researchers conducted DIBELS with both treatment and control students at the beginning and end of LLI . Intervention Fidelity Leveled Literacy Inter vention Observation Tool (LLIOT) The LLIOT, developed by CREP researchers for the purposes of the study, involves a targeted, 30 the LLI model as wel l as the quality of their literacy instructional strategies and the learning environment of the lesson. Ratings are provided using a 4 - point scale that ranges from 0 (Not Observed) to 3 (Excellent). Containing 20 items, the LLIOT is comprised of 3 subsca les: Quality of LLI Implementation, which is Literacy Instructional Strategies, which is strategies that should be present in a successful literacy intervention; and Learning Environment, which is designed to assess the quality of lesson factors such as organization, pacing, and the availability of materials. On - site researchers trained by CREP conducted observatio ns of two intervention sessions with each participating LLI group, one near the beginning of the study period and one near the end, using the LLIOT. This observation data contribute d to the evaluation of fidelity to the LLI model. To ensure the reliabili ty of data, observers received a manual which provided definitions of terms, examples and explanations of target strategies, and a description of procedures for completing the instruments. Observers also received instruction on the instrument in a group s ession and parti cipated in practice exercises. LLI Data Management System Intervention Record The Intervention Record in the LLI data management system was used for tracking student and teacher attendance, reasons for absence, student reading selections , and achievement level. This data management tool allows for individual or group reports to be created based on various criteria. CREP utilize d the new online version of this data management program to access the se intervention records, which provide d an additional source of measurement of the fidelity of LLI implementation at each school. School Support for Literacy: Instructional Staff Surveys LLI Teacher Questionnaire (LLITQ) An existing LLI t eacher q uestionnaire that CREP had developed for a pr evious evaluation of LLI was modified and used in this study as a measure of the participating LLI efficacy of LLI , their implementation of the LLI . The LLITQ consists of 21 items on a 5 - point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), 5 items on a 4 - point scale ranging from 0 (Not At All) to 3 (Extensively), 5 items on a 5 - point scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (Always), and 3 open - ended items rega rding strengths and areas for improvement as well as reasons to continue or not continue using the LLI syste m. The LLITQ was administered to participating LLI teachers at the end of LLI . Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 22 Classroom Teacher Literacy Instruction Questionnaire (CTLIQ) CREP also modified a previously developed teacher survey regarding literacy programs as a measure of the overall support for literacy in the participating schools and the nature of the regular classroom literacy instruction received by the students in the study. The CTLIQ assessed classroom - reported literacy instructional practices and their perceptions of the core literacy program at their schools. The CTLIQ consists of 20 items on a 5 - point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (S trongly Agree), 5 items on a 4 - point scale ranging from 0 (Not At All) to 3 (Extensively), 10 items on a 5 - point scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (Regularly), and 3 open - ended items regarding program strengths and areas for improvement as well as reasons literacy program. The CTLIQ was administered to K - 2 classroom teachers with either treatment or control students in the study at the end of LLI . Focus Groups Structured focus groups were conducted with both LLI teachers and on - site researchers at the end of the study period. Participating LLI teachers discussed their general view of LLI, logistical issues they encountered with implementing the system throughout the scho ol year, strengths and areas for improvement, and their perceptions of the LLI online data management system, which was piloted by the publisher during the current study. On - site researchers also discussed their perceptions of strengths and ar eas for improvement as well as their general opinion of LLI, based on their random observations of LLI lessons. Table 5 summarizes each of the research questions and the participants and provides the data sources and methodology used to investigate each q uestion.

In the spring of 2009, three CREP researchers were responsible for ensuring that the districts understood and agreed to participate in the study while implementing LLI as intended by the developers. A series of meetings was held with Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 23 key district - level administrators along with a presentation to all teach ers who would be part of the study. Additionally, an LLI school coordinator was identified from the team of LLI teachers at each participating school to coordinate data collection activities with CREP and help ensure smooth LLI implementation. By the end of June 2009, orientation to the project along with district agreement was finalized. On - site researchers were also identified from a pool of local - area retired teachers during summer 2009, and a day - long training was organized to prepare them for the f all 2009 initiation of the evaluation. This on - site training included a detailed orientation to the LLI curriculum and evaluation as well as familiarization, thorough training, and practice with the assessment and observation instruments that the on - site researchers would administer (i.e., the DIBELS and LLIOT). Prior to the first day of the 2009 - 2010 school year in each district, CREP researchers met separately with the teachers and the on - site researchers to finalize the timeline and logistics for pre - testing the first and second graders (kindergarteners received LLI during spring 2010). After the school year began, the schools in each district provided CREP with a list of first and second grade students that they had identified as eligible for LLI us ing their own selection criteria and whose parents had provided consent to participate in the study. Pre - testing of these students with the LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS began during the first three weeks of school. Subsequently, CREP conducted the randomiza tion of the matched pairs of first and second graders based on demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, ELL status, special education status, and free/reduced lunch status) and pre - test LLI benchmark scores of instructional reading level. Stu dents in the treatment group were then placed in LLI groups by LLI teachers, and the planned 90 days of LLI instruction for first and second graders began. Control group students did not receive LLI until the first and second grade evaluation period ended , and neither treatment nor control students received any additional pull - out literacy interventions during the study period. On - site researchers used the LLIOT to conduct two random observations of each first and second grade LLI group between October 2 009 and February 2010, with one observation for each group occurring towards the beginning of LLI and one occurring towards the end. Post - tests with the LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS for the first and second grade students were completed in February for TCS a nd March for ECSDM . LLI school coordinators were also asked to encourage all first and second grade LLI teachers and first and second grade classroom teachers with students in the study to complete an online survey regarding either LLI or the regular clas sroom literacy program as applicable. CREP assisted in the online survey process by providing instructions and log - in information to all participating teachers. The first and second grade teacher surveys were administered in February and March 2010. CRE P researchers returned to both districts during February and March 2010 to conduct a refresher training on the DIBELS and LLIOT for the on - site researchers prior to the start of pre - testing the kindergarteners in the study. Follow - up visits with LLI teach ers were also conducted at this time to discuss and address any concerns about the study thus far and to ascertain any issues related to LLI implementation and/or the online data management system that all LLI teachers were asked to use as part of the stud y. In late winter 2010, participating schools identified kindergarteners who were eligible for LLI and whose parents had provided consent for them to participate in the study. Pre - testing of these kindergarten students using the LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS began in February in TCS and March in ECSDM . Subsequently, these students were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups using the same randomization procedure that was utilized for first and second grade. Kindergartners in the treatment group re ceived LLI beginning in February in TCS and April in ECSDM . As with the first and second grade groups, two random LLIOT observations were conducted for each kindergarten LLI group between March and May 2010. Post - testing of kindergarteners on the LLI Ben chmarks and DIBELS was conducted during May 2010 in TCS and June 2010 in ECSDM . Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 24 During May and June 2010, end - of - year meetings were held with on - site researchers and LLI teachers to debrief them, discuss any remaining issues, and conduct structured focus groups. The purpose of the focus groups was to collect qualitative data related to the study, the LLI materials, the LLI . Finally, LLI school coordinators were also asked to encourage all LLI and classroom teachers of kindergarten students in the study to complete an online survey regarding either LLI or the regular classroom literacy program as applicable. CREP assisted in the online survey process by providing instructi ons and log - in information to all participating teachers. The kindergarten teacher surveys were administered in May and June 2010. Table 6 provides a summary of data collection procedures, including the instruments organized by type, a general timeline a nd description of the data collection process, and the number received for each instrument.

Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 25 Number of Days of LLI Instruction Overall across both districts, the first and second grade LLI students received, on average, 72.9 days of instruction between August 2009 and March 2010, with a range of 40 - 90 days of instruction. Between February and June 2010, the kindergar ten LLI students received, on average, 37.5 days of instruction, with individual students ranging in their attendance from 27 to 46 days. In the five participating schools in Tift County Schools, the first and second grade LLI students received, on aver age, 78.9 days of instruction between August 2009 and February 2010, with individual students ranging in their attendance from 70 to 90 days. Between February and May 2010, the kindergarten LLI students in TCS received, on average, 36.7 days of instructio n, with individual students ranging in their attendance from 27 to 46 days. In the four participating schools in the Enlarged City School District of Middletown , the first and second grade LLI students received, on average, 68.1 days of instruction betw een October 2009 and March 2010, with individual students ranging in their attendance from 40 to 78 days. Between April and June 2010, the kindergarten LLI students in ECSDM received, on average, 38.7 days of instruction, with individual students ranging in their attendance from 36 to 42 days. Results The following section presents the results of the evaluation, discussed in relation to each instrument and each grade level . First, a summary of the quantitative and qualitative results will be presented , and t he conclusion section will further discuss these results as they pertain to each of the research questions in the present study. Preliminary Analyses As the LLI benchmarks were scored in terms of alphabetic levels (i.e., pre - A, A, B, C, etc.), the se outcomes first had to be recoded into numeric equivalents before analysis. Additionally, because some students were unable to reach the initial benchmark Level A as measured in the LLI benchmark system, we created a new category, pre - A benchmark level , in order to assign scores to those who were below Level A so those students could be included in the study. All benchmark outcomes were assigned within gro analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures was conducted on the transformed measures to determine whether larger gains were observed for one of the two conditions overall (i.e., LLI/treatment vs. delayed - LLI/control) and for several demographic subgroup s nested within the two conditions (e.g., ethnicity, special education status, English Language Learner status) . Also, variations in the sample sizes across each analysis were seen due to limited cases of missing data. In the total sample, any cases with missing data could not be included in the analysis. Missing data resulted from several situations: 1) only cases with both pre - test and post - test data were able to be included in the - off s, which meant some students may not have had a score if they could not meet the minimum frustration level; and 3) students were allowed to voluntarily participate in the testing. Tests for normality of data and statistical assumptions (i.e., normal distr ibution; independence of measures) as well as measures of central tendency (i.e., means, standard deviations) were conducted on all outcomes for each grade level prior to the series of mixed ANOVAs. Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 26 Descriptive Student Achievement Results: Kindergarten LL I Benchmarks and DIBELS Kindergarten LLI Benchmarks On average after 38 days of LLI instruction, k indergartners who received LLI achieved a mean gain of 1.56 benchmark levels as compared to 0.78 benchmark levels for kindergartners who did not receive LLI. Also, kindergartners in LLI started, on average, below grade level in benchmark testing (i.e., pre - A = 0) but finished at a level between A and B, whereas their counterparts in the control group started near pre - A and finished around Level A. Thus, kindergartners in LLI finished the school year close to grade level in literacy (i . e ., end - of - year K grade level goal = Level C ). Also of note, English Language L earner (ELL) , African American, and Hispanic students in LLI exceeded those in the control group . ELL students i n LLI achieved a mean gain of about 1 ½ benchmark level s (M = 1.55 ) compared to a ½ benchmark level (M = 0.50) for ELL students not in LLI. African American LLI students also gained about 1 ½ benchmark levels (M = 1.44) whil e those in the control group only gained less than a benchmark level (M = 0.7 9 ). Finally, Hispanic students in LLI made the most gains almost 2 benchmark levels (M = 1.76) versus their counterparts in the control group who gained less than a benchmark lev el (0.70). Also, all three subgroups finished closer to grade level (i.e., Level C ) than their counterparts who finished around Level A or below. Kindergarten DIBELS Overall, fewer significant gains were seen with the DIBELS outcomes. However, kindergar tners in LLI significantly exceeded those who were not in LLI on nonsense word fluency (NWF) (M = 10.64% and M = 6.88%, respectively). Also, for phoneme segmentation fluency (PSF) , ELL students in the treatment group (M = 46.72%) outperformed ELL students in the control group (M = 23.96 %), as well as non - ELL students in both the treatme nt and control groups (M = 23.24 % and 24.24%, respectively). Thus, kindergartners who participated in LLI showed more significant gains on subtests of the DIBELS as compare d to those who did not have LLI. Pre - test to Post - test Student Achievement Results: Mixed ANOVA Outcome s for Kindergarten LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS Kindergarten LLI Benchmarks A s shown in Table 7 , when the gains made by treatment and control group students were compared, highly significant differences favoring the treatment group were observed for the analysis involving all students ( F (1, 144) = 23.74, p < .001, = 0.14) . Although no statisticall y significant difference between conditions was observed when the gains made by White students ( F (1, 39) = 2.20, ns , = 0.05) and students with a special education (SPED) designation ( F (1, 12) = 1.71, ns , = 0.13) were analyzed, results favoring the trea tment group were systematically observed when the analyses focused on African American students only (F (1, 51) = 6.69, p < .05, = 0.12), ELL students only (F (1, 21) = 6.68, p < .05, = 0.2 4), and Hispanic students only (F (1, 48) = 16.22, p < .001, = 0.25). As reflected in the magnitude of the effect sizes, the impact of treatment appeared to be especially robust with respect to literacy development in the latter two groups.

Kindergarten DIBELS To contrast the pre - and post - test scores of kindergartners in treatment and control groups on the LLI Benchmarks , a second series of mixed Analysis of Variance (ANOVAs) was conducted on the means of four DIBELS measures of reading fluency. On three of four such measures specifically, DIBELS Initial Sound Fluency (ISF, as shown in Table 9 ) , Letter Naming Fluency (LN F, as shown in Table 10 ) , and Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF, as shown in Table 11 ) no statistically significant differences in average student performance were observed either for groups of k indergarten students in the aggregate or for subgroups of k in dergarten students disaggregated by ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, and White), ELL status, or special education status. However, as see n in Table 8 on the DIBELS measure of Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF), statistically significant differences were observed favoring treatment students. As shown i n Table 8 , such differences were observed for treatment students in the aggregate ( F (1, 139) = 5. 97 , p < .05, = 0.04 ), as well for treatment students who were classified as ELL ( F (1, 21) = 4.90, p < .05, = 0.19 ) . Although the difference in perform ance on the NWF outcome for students with a special education designation (SPED) was not statistically significant, the effect size associated with the pre - test to post - test outcome suggests that the advantage of the treatment for these students over their counterparts in the control group was, nevertheless, a considerable one ( F (1, 1 2) = 1.55, ns , = 0.11 ) .

Kindergarten Difference Score Analysis for LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS: Overall and by Subgroups Additionally, we conducted analyses on treatment and control group difference scores (i.e., pre - test to post - test difference) in order to determine if any significant gain, or rate of change over time, was found for either group. From the pre - and post - te st outcomes on the benchmark tests and DIBELS Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 29 measures, difference scores were computed and analyzed for treatment and control group stude nts in the aggregate. Within this analysis, education and ELL status es was contrasted as was the performance of student subgroups by ethnicity. Overall , relative to the performance of control group students, significant differences were observed for the gains made by treatment group students on both the LLI be nchmark s ( t (144) = 4.87, p < .001, d = .80) and the DIBELS measure of Nonsense Word Fluency ( t (139) = 2.45, p < .05, d = .41) (see Table 12 ) .

With regard to subgroups, however, the only significant differences observed were the student gains on the DIBELS measure of Phoneme Segmentation Fluency . Specifically , significant differences were observed among students by experimental group and ELL status (F( 1, 136) = 6.53, p < .05, = 0.05) as seen in Table 1 3 , and among students by experimental group and ethnicity being African American or Hispanic (F( 1, 95) = 4.03, p < .05, = 0.04) as shown in Table 14 . With regard to the first result, follow - up testing indicated that the gains made by ELL students in the treatment group ( M = 34.60, SD = 20.78) were superior to those made by non - ELL students in the treatment group ( M = 12.20, SD = 15.84) and to those made by both ELL students ( M = 15.16, SD = 14.27) and non - ELL students ( M = 13.43, SD = 19.49) in the control group. As regards the latter outcome, the gains made by treatment group Hispanic students ( M = 24.71, SD = 21.02) outpaced those made by African American students in the tre atment group ( M = 9.98, SD = 12.38).

Desc riptive Student Achievement Results: 1st G rade LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS 1 st G rade LLI Benchmarks On average after 73 days of LLI instruction, 1 st graders who received LLI achieved a mean gain of 4.46 benchmark levels as compared to 2.63 benchmark levels f or 1 st graders who did not receive LLI. Also, 1 st graders in LLI started generally below grade level in benchmark testing (i.e., Level A = 1 ) b ut finished at a level between E and F , whereas their counterparts in the control group started near L evel A and finished around L evel D . Thus, 1 st graders in LLI finished their LLI sessions at the grade level mid - year goal in literacy ( i.e. , mid - year grade level goal for 1 st grade = Level s E/F ) , while the control group students were still slightly behind . Als o of note, African American and Hispanic students in LLI exceeded those in the control group . African American LLI students made the most gains they gained about 5 ½ benchmark levels (M = 5.20 ) while those in the control group only gained about 2 ½ benchm ark levels (M = 2.60 ). Finally, Hispanic students in LLI also made significant gains about 4 benchmark levels (M = 4.18 ) versus their counterparts in the control group who gained about 2 ½ benchmark level s ( M = 2.57 ). Also, both subgroups finished at the grade level goal (i.e., Level E/F) compared to their counterparts in the contr ol group who finished close to L evel D. Of importance to note, the finding for African American 1 st graders in LLI appears particularly robust and educationally significant. T hese LLI students finished the highest out of all subgroups as well as the aggregate close to Level G versus all others who finished between Level s C to F . 1 st G rade DIBELS Overall, similar significant differences between treatment and control groups were seen with the 1 st grade DIBELS outcomes. 1 st graders in LLI significantly exceeded those who were not in LLI on nonsen se word fluency (NWF) (M = 22. 0 0% and M = 17.00 %, respectively). Also, for NWF , H ispanic students in the treatment group (M = 19. 0 0 %) outperformed their counterpart s in the control group (M = 17. 0 0%). Additionally, 1 st graders who received LLI performed better than their counterparts on Oral Reading Fluency (M = 10. 0 0% and M = 7. 0 0% , respectively), as well as on Letter Naming Fluency (M = 17. 0 0% and M = 11. 0 0% , respectively). Thus, 1 st graders who participated in LLI showed more significant gains on subtests of the DIBELS as compared to those who did not have LLI.

From the pre - and post - test outcomes on the benchmark tests and DIBELS measures, difference scores were computed an d analyzed for treatment and control group students in the aggregate. Within this analysis ecial education status and ELL status was contrasted as was the performance of student subgroups by ethnicity. Overall, relative to the performance of control group students, statistically significant gains were made by treatment group students on both the LLI Benchmarks ( F = 31.97, p < .001, d = 1.26) and the DIBELS measure of Nonsense Word Fluency ( F = 10.54, p = .001, d = .58) ( se e Table 19 ) .

With regard to subgroups, there were several significant results. While not central to our hypotheses in the study, the analyses by the three ethnic subgroups (s ee Table 20 ) revealed there was a statistically significant difference among ethnicity for control students who did not receive LLI on the DIBLES measure for Nonsense Word Fluency (F = 6.24, p = .003, ( d = - 1.32 W vs. AA, d = - .33 W vs. H, d = .85 AA vs. H)), with Whi te and Hispanic control students outperforming African American control students.

Also, 2 nd graders in LLI started, on average, below grade l evel in benchmark testing (i.e., Level E = 5 ) but finished at Level J , whereas their counterparts in the control group started closer to Level F but onl y finished around Level I . Thus, 2 nd graders in LLI finished the school year close to the grade level mid - year goal in literacy ( i.e. , mid - year grade level goal for 2 nd grade = Level J/K ). Also of note, while no significant effects were found for ELL students , a robust effect was found for students with a special education designation who received LLI. These students in the treatment group started around Level C and finished closer to Level H, while their counterparts in the control group started at Level D and finished around Level F. Also, regarding ethnicity subgroups, White students in LLI finished above their counterparts in the control group, gaining about 5 benchmark levels (M = 5.05) compared to about 3 benchmark levels (M = 3.14) in the cont rol group. Additionally, African American and Hispanic students in LLI exceeded their counterparts in the contr ol group . Of particular educational significance, Af rican American LLI students finished at the highest level compared to all others just above Level I; however, this was closely followed by the Hispanic LLI students who also finished slightly above Level I on average. The African American students in the treatment group gained about 4 ½ benchmark levels (M = 4.46 ) while those in the control gro up only gained about 2 ½ benchmark levels (M = 2.67 ). Finally, Hispanic students in LLI gained more than African American students in LLI (M = 4.53 and M = 4.46, respectively) while Hispanic students in the control group only gained about 3 benchmark leve ls. 2 nd G rade DIBELS Overall, no significant differences were found between treatment and control groups for 2 nd grade on either DIBELS subtest that was administered as intended for 2 nd graders (i.e., Nonsense W ord Fluency and Oral Reading F luency). While unexpected, this result may simply indicate that the 2 nd grade DIBELS measures were not sufficiently aligned with the 2 nd grade LLI curriculum or benchmarks to detect small effects, or changes, in DIBELS scores. However, it is also plausible that th e lack of an overall effect may be due to district - level differences in these scores.

Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 36 2nd Grade Difference Score Analysis for LLI Benchmarks and DIBELS: Overall and by Subgroups Additionally, we conducted analyses on treatment and control group difference scores (i.e , pre - test to post - test difference) in order to determine if any significant gain, or rate of change over time, was found for either group. From the pre - and post - test outcomes on the benchmark tests and DIBELS measures, difference scores were computed an d analyzed for treatment and control group students in the aggregate . Within this analysis education and ELL statuses was contrasted as was the performance of student subgroups by ethnicity. Ov erall, as compared to the control group, statistically significant differences were observed for the gains made by treatment group students on the LLI Benchmarks ( F = 22.58, p < .001, d = .78) (se e Table 25 ) . However, no significant differences on either DIBELS subtest was found overall in 2 nd grade, as shown in Table 25 .

With regard to the subgroup of special education status shown in Table 2 6 , the only statistically significant difference was observed on the LLI benchmarks, with the control students without a special education designation (non - SPED) scoring statistically significantly higher than the control students with a special edu cation designation (SPED) (F = 4.31, p = .04, d = - .75). It should be noted that the sample size for the control students with a special education designation (N = 9) was very small. There were no statistically significant differences by special educatio n status for students in the treatment group. However, again, the sample size for LLI students with a special education designation (N = 5) was very small and may not have been sufficient to detect effects. For the ELL subgroup (se e Table 27 ) , there were no statistically significant differences in gains between ELL and non - ELL students within either the treatment or control groups. Also, there were no statistically significant differences in gains between ethnicities within either the treatment or contro l groups (see Tables 28 and 29 ) .

Table 30 illustrates the frequencies for each item on the LLIOT, as observed during the visits. The results from the LLIOT revealed that 5 of the time, indicating a high level of impl ementation fidelity across both districts. The highest rated lesson components (i.e., those demonstrating the highest degree of implementation fidelity) included phonics/word work, reading a new book, and rereading, 97.6%, 95.7% , and 95.0% of the time, respectively. The lowest rated lesson components (i.e., those demonstrating the lowest degree of implementation fidelity) included classroom and home connections, which were not observed 51.9% and 22.5% of the ti me, respectively. Teachers were also rated highly on their use of literacy instructional strategies, such as modeling and encouraging fluent oral reading in problem - solving (95.6%). Further, in the majority of observed lessons, instructional materials were read ily available; the lesson was well - organized; and students were engaged and attentive (100.0%, tively). Overall, observers perceived that the lesson was delivered as designed 96.3% of the time. All items can be found in Table 30 below.

Observers conducting the LLIOT also recorded open - ended comments summarizing the instructional materials used during the lesson and their perceptions of the quality of instruction, level of Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 40 student participation, and overall success of the lesson. Of the 163 comments, 71.8% were related to the lesson resources and materials, 41.1% were related to student participation and engagement in the lesson, 38.7% were related to the quality of literacy instru ction, and 20.9% were related to the success of the lesson 5 . In most of the comments, observers reported that a wide variety of instructional materials were readily available, the quality of instruction (e.g., pacing, teaching str ategies, organization) wa s high; the students were ac tively engaged and enthusiastic; and the lesson was implemented successfully. However, multiple observers commented that the lesson could not adequately be completed within the designated 30 - minute timeframe. Sample comments f rom the observers are provided below. Lesson #81 was observed. All materials were readily available. Students were on task and eager to interact with all aspects of the lesson. Lesson #14.

They stayed focused and it was evident that they were q uite pleased with themselves. Students seemed used to routine and complied with all directives. All materials needed were readily av ailable for lesson 34. Comparative Pre - test to Post - test Results The LLIOT was conducted at both the beginning and the end of LLI for each of the observed groups in order to measure changes in implementation over time. For 1 st and 2 nd grade, pre - test ob servations were conducted in October and November 2009, and post - test observations were conducted in January and February 2010. For kindergarten, pre - test observations were conducted in March and April 2010, and post - test observations were conducted in Ap ril and May 2010. Results are summarized by grade level below. Kindergarten For each of the two occasions on which 25 k indergarten LLI groups were observed, the means and standard deviations presented in Table 32 were computed on the three subscales of th e LLIOT . Subsequently, three independent t - tests that contrasted teacher behaviors at times one and two were conducted on the pairs of means obtained on the LLIO - ( t (23) = 0.81, p = 0.422 ) , its six - t (23) = - 0.40, p = 0.692 ) , and its seven - scale ( t (23) = - 0.18, p = 0.860 ), with no statistically significant differences observed for any of the three comparisons.

Table 33 illustrates the frequencies of responses for each item on the LLITQ. Most of the respondents reported positive perceptions of LLI and its implementation i n their individual schools. LLI teachers indicated that th ey had a good understanding of LLI ; received support in implementing LLI from their district, school administration, and other school staff; and perceived a positive impact on student achievement a nd student attitudes towards literacy. LLI teachers also reported a positive impact of LLI on their reading instruction, particularly their understanding of the role of comprehension and phonics/phonemic awareness in the reading process and the relationsh ip of leveled texts to successful reading. Further, LLI teachers reported implementing the LLI system with a high degree of fidelity; the majority of teachers indicated that they met with their groups daily for at least 30 minutes, followed the lesson des ign, and implemented both reading and writing activities. Overall, LLI teachers were most likely to agree that they understood the goals and student li teracy achievement (97.7%), and that their districts and other teachers within their schools were supportive of LLI (each 93.2%). LLI teachers were least likely to agree that the parents of their LLI Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 42 students participated in home literacy activities with 6 and ELL (100.0%) agreed that their school should continue LLI .

The LLITQ also invited LLI teachers to share open - ended comments regarding the strengths and weaknesses of LLI and the reasons that their schools should continue or not continu e using the LLI system . With respect to strengths, the majority of comments (81.0%) 7 focused on the LLI resources and materials. Teachers particularly liked the leveled texts, commenting that they were well - written and engaging to students. Several comm ents (35.7%) also focused on instructional strategies, including small group format and structure and consistency of lessons, and a few (4.8%) mentioned student achievement as a strength of LLI . 7 Perce ntages do not add up to 100% because a single comment may have addressed more than one theme. Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 44 With regard to areas of improvement for LLI , teachers again mentioned resources the majority of the time (80.5%), citing inconsistency among materials (e.g., differences between activities, books, and CD resources) and materials that did not appear to be level - appropriate. Teachers also frequently men tioned lesson design (34.1%), stating that the system was too fast - paced and that they could not cover all of the lesson ma terial during the designated 30 - minute timeframe. When asked why their school should continue using the LLI system , teachers equally cited student achievement (41.5%) and benefit to ELL students and students with special needs (41.5%) an rated LLI as helping ELL students and studen approximately one - third of the time (29.6% and 38.6%, respectively). No teachers provided a reason for their school to discontinue the use of LLI. Sample comments from the LLI teachers are provided belo w. What are the strengths of the Leveled Literacy Intervention system ? I love the books that are provided for the program. They are current and fun. The children are excited about reading them. The children really enjoy doing the plays during familiar reading t It provides a safety net for those students who still need extra support in addition to the regular classroom instruction. Students enjoyed coming to LLI class and were motivated and excited about reading each day.

Results from the CTLIQ revealed that classroom teachers of both treatment and control students were most likely to provide individual or small - group reading instruction, integrate vocabulary and comprehension int o their literacy instruction, and utilize high - quality literature to read to students and engage them in interactive discussions about the text guided rea (94.4%) and teaching phonological awareness to their students (93.2%). Teachers were least likely to report utilizing whole - literacy activities for students to complete with parents (6.7%). Teachers were most likely to agree that they u nderstood the goals of their literacy program, that it was aligned with state and district reading/language arts standards, and that their faculty, staff, and administration believed that all students could learn to read and write (93.3%, 93.3%, and 92.1% likely to agree that the parents of their students participated in home literacy activities with their ), that their schools had sufficient faculty and staff to continue their current literacy program.

Yes 83.1 No 9.0 Note: Item percentages may not total 100% because of missing input from some respondents. The CTLIQ also invited classroom teachers to share open - ended comments regarding the continue or not continue the literacy program. Regarding program strengths, most comments (3 6.8%) 8 cited instructional strategies, particularly the opportunities to provide differentiated and small group instruction. One - third of the comments (33.3%) focused on the resources and materials available to both students and teachers (e.g., a variety of books), while several comments (22.8%) stated that the program is individualized and allows students to succeed at their own level. A few comments (3.5%) also mentioned school climate (e.g., teachers/staff, support from literacy coaches and administrat ion). With respect to areas for improvement, teachers most frequently mentioned materials (50.0% of comments), particularly the need for more guided reading texts. The comments also recommended increased help for at - risk students (11.5%), more profession al development (9.6%), improved instructional strategies (e.g., guided reading, one - on - one time, phonics instruction; 9.6%), and additional resources (e.g., better coaching/support, more intervention staff, improved time management; 7.7%). A few comments (5.8%) also mentioned LLI, with one teacher stating that all teachers should receive training in LLI and two teachers requesting better communication between LLI teachers and classroom teachers. When asked why their school should continue its current lite racy program, teachers most frequently cited a positive impact on student achievement (41.4% of comments), while some teachers voted not to continue the current literacy program because it does not meet the needs of all students (5.1% of comments). In 8.6 % of comments, teachers voted specifically to continue the use of LLI , with I believe that children that struggle would give up hope in the realm of reading without the LLI program. Some teachers stated that their school must find a way to serve more students with LLI if it is to continue (5.2% of comments), while others reported that they did not know enough about LLI to offer an opinion about whether their school should continue it (3.4% of comments ). Sample comments fr om the classroom teachers are provided belo w . 8 Percentages do not add up to 100% because a single comment may have addressed more than one theme.

The amount of guided reading we are teaching sometimes makes it challenging to find multiple copies at the A, B and C levels. We need more staff to service all the children who need [intervention services] . We need more consistent communication between administration and classroom teachers in the form of shared collaboration. Teachers also need to be able to give their input on whom should be chosen for LLI services. It should not be based ONLY on a one time score. Why should your school continue or not continue with the current literacy program? because it provides exce llent instruction for students at their academic level. Each Focus Groups Two focus groups one with the LLI teachers and one with the on - site researchers responsible for conducting the LLIOT observations and DIBELS assessments were conducted in each district at the end of the study in May and June 2010. Approximately 25 LLI teachers and 9 on - site researchers across both districts participated in the focus groups. For both the LLI te achers and the on - site researchers, t he focus groups were qualitatively coded into themes and categories from each of the two focus group sessions to summarize perception s of LLI . Each of the 166 LLI teacher responses and the 84 on - site researcher responses was represented in a category or individually under its thematic area; no responses were omitted from qualitative analysis. Then, the responses in each category were summed across both focus group session s for each group (LLI teachers and on - site researchers) to determine the most frequent responses overall for each theme. The following paragraphs summarize the results. LLI Teachers An interview protocol with five questions was utilized in the focus groups with LLI teachers. The part icipants discussed their perceptions related to their general view of LLI , logistical issues they encountered with implementing the system throughout the school year, strengths and areas for improvement, and suggestions to improve the LLI online data management s ystem, which was piloted by the publisher during the current study. Results are summarized by question below. Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 49 General View of LLI Overall, most of the LLI teachers who participated in the focus groups stated that they liked LLI and felt that it was beneficial to their students. Many of these teachers were particularly impressed with the books used in the system . A few teachers reported liking LLI because it provides them with everything that they need to teach, while others com mented that it is fast - paced, engaging to students, and well - organized with an effective format and structure. Some teachers responded that LLI needs more work, describing it as labor intensive and time consuming. Specific areas of concern for these teac hers included the pace of the system , which they felt was too fast for their lower - level students, and the large amount of information to cover in each lesson (particularly even - numbered lessons). Several teachers also described the school - level variables that they felt needed improvement in order to implement LLI correctly, including the need for more time, more administrative support, more materials, and more parental support. With regard to the last item, teachers recommended a bilingual informational video that could be sent home to parents at the beginning of LLI as well as a policy of removing students with frequent absences from LLI . Finally, a few teachers commented that LLI can only be implemented effectively if the teachers are extremely organi zed and familiar with the material. Logistical Issues with Implementation When asked about the logistical issues related to implementation, most of the LLI teachers schedules in order to meet with all of their LLI groups. Several teachers also commented that they could not finish the lesson during the designated 30 - minute timeframe, while a few pointed out that interruptions (including assemblies, half days, state as sessments, and the fact that LLI teachers were often pulled to assist with non - intervention activities) frequently prevented them from meeting with their groups. A few teachers also stated that th ey did not have enough planning time to adequate ly prepare for their LLI groups. In addition to the scheduling issues, some LLI teachers commented that they experienced resistance from classroom teachers throughout the LLI implementation; however, these respondents ce was related to this research study rather than LLI itself (i.e., the classroom teachers did not understand that, due to the need for a treatment and control group, some of their LLI - eligible students would not receive LLI right away). Respondents point ed out that they received more support from the classroom teachers when they worked with them on scheduling. A few respondents even reported that some classroom teachers came to observe their LLI groups in order to learn more about LLI ; as a result, these classroom teachers became more supportive of LLI. Other logistical issues that were reported less frequently included grouping students at different levels from different classrooms, becoming familiar with all of the LLI materials, and the large amount o f practice activities for slower learners, and the need for more parental support. Strengths of LLI The LLI instructional materials, particularly the bo oks and take - home books, were most frequently mentioned by the LLI teachers in the focus groups as strengths of LLI . Respondents felt that the books were high - quality (well - written, fun, colorful, etc.), covered a variety of high - interest topics, and were enjoyable to students. Further, they appreciated the take - home books because many of their students did not have books at home, and the take - home books reinforced learning outside of the LLI group. Teachers also liked the T G uide and the Lesson Resources CD. In addition to the Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 50 materials, several teachers also mentioned the guided lessons and the fact that everything was already in place for them to teach, while some mentioned the writing component or the fact that the system includes both a read ing and a writing component. A few teachers also cited the 3 - to - 1 group size, the Reading Records, the repetition and consistency of lessons, the lesson layout, and the ease of - included concept building, the integration of both phonics and comprehension, the use of Fountas & that the system addresses bot h instructional and independent reading levels. Areas for Improvement When asked about the areas of LLI that could be improved, LLI teachers most frequently mentioned the timeframe for the lessons, stating that they could not complete the lesson in 30 min utes and generally required approximately 45 minutes to cover all of the material. Several teachers also materials), that the system was too fast - paced for at - risk students, and that the amount of information presented in each lesson could be overwhelming to students. Several teachers also recommended and de rive directly from the text. Some teachers also disagreed with the examples used for certain hile one is an exception), and including words suggested providing more skill review so that mastery can be obtained before progressing to the next skill, providi ng a more specific vocabulary introduction for each book, and reducing the amount of words per page, which can be problematic for teachers in schools that limit their number of photocopies per month). Finally, other recommendations included providing tips to help students who continue to struggle; increasing the size of the ABC, word, and picture cards; and incorporating a handwriting component. Suggestions for the Online Data Management System LLI teachers were also asked about their experiences with the new online data management system and any suggestions that they might have for improving the system. Overall, the most frequent complaint was that the sys teachers reported that this problem worsened if more than one teacher at their school attempted to use the system at once. Many teachers also stated that their data would not save or that it would disappear and reappear, particularly in the N otes section. Several teachers also reported difficulty with the individual and group weekly records; however, these problems may have been due to the fact that some teachers did not know to firs t enter the information in the group weekly record and then edit it for individual students if needed in the individual weekly record. Suggestions for the weekly records included improving the ability to enter reasons for teacher and student unavailabilit y, adding an option holidays for one group. Some teachers also noted that there is not a way to transfer students in the system from one group or LLI te acher to another, which means that the student still appears in his/her are not connected. Finally, some teachers complained about the process of obtai ning technical support, to several employees before finding someone that could help. Teachers also reported that they were not always able to be on t heir computer when calling technical support (e.g., if they must use the Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 51 a live help chat. Overall, teachers suggested that the use of the online data management system could be improved with on - site, in - person training on the computer, a more user - friendly manual, and additional resources, such as a step - by - step demonstration video or presentation that could be available for website, a quick - and was easy to use once they learned how to use it. A few teachers reported not experiencing any problems with the system. Finally, some teachers commented that they liked the system, particularly the layout and the ability to access individual and grou p reports. On - site R esearchers Because the on - site researchers for the study were all retired teachers who had experience teaching in the two school districts in the study, CREP researchers utilized focus groups to solicit their feedback regarding LLI . Th e on - perspective based on their random observations of the LLI groups. On - site researchers were asked to discuss their perceptions of strengths and areas for improvement as well as thei r opinion of LLI in general (i.e., as experienced teachers, what would they think of having LLI in their schools?). Results are summarized by question below. Strengths of LLI Most of the on - site researchers cited group management by the LLI teachers as a strength of the LLI implementation in the current study (e.g., the use of prompts, reinforcement, and rapport with the students and the ability to deal effectively with behavior problems). In terms of LLI in general, on - site researchers fre quently cited t he fact that LLI builds student confidence, is very well - organized, and can be adapted to different teaching styles and real - world learning situations. Some on - site researchers were also impressed with LLI 3 - to - 1 group size. Other strengths mentioned by the on - site researchers included the books, the level of training received by the LLI teachers, and the range of students that can benefit from LLI (e.g., older students as well as early childhood students a nd students with special needs or behavior problems). Areas for Improvement When asked what areas of LLI could be improved, on - site researchers most frequently responded that the Reading Records were too long and took up too much time during the even - numbe red lessons. They recommended establishing a time or word limit for the Reading Record, providing more activities for other students to complete during the assessment time, or even allowing the Reading Record to be done on a separate day if possible. Som e on - site researchers also felt that the Reading Record should be used as a general indicator of progress and that the LLI teacher should be able to decide how much of the record to complete for each student. In addition to their comments about the Readin g Records, several on - site researchers echoed system was too fast - paced for slower learners. A few on - site researchers also felt that the group format could be d istracting for younger students, particularly when doing choral reading. Other areas for improvement suggested by the on - site researchers included a perceived overemphasis on comprehension, a belief that the skills presented in the system are too advanced for struggling students, Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 52 the difficulty in sharing materials between groups, and the need for more writing and a stronger parental component. On - site researchers also recommended better communication between LLI teachers and classroom teachers in order t o streamline the process of getting students to their LLI groups on time as well as to improve the classroom connection component of the curriculum. Overall Opinion of LLI When asked what they would think as experienced teachers about having LLI in their s chools (i.e., the benefits and drawbacks of implementing such a system ), the majority of on - site researchers in the focus groups were positively supportive of LLI and indicated that they would like to have this system if they were still teaching. On - site researchers generally saw LLI as a systematic approach to literacy intervention that covers all of the necessary components, is high - interest for students, and can be effective with a range of early childhood students. On - site researchers commented that t hey liked the leveled texts, small group format, instructional techniques (including the emphasis on phonics y over time. Some on - site researchers also commented that LLI is similar to the Reading Recovery program, which would make it easier for districts already implementing Reading Recovery to adopt LLI. Some on - site researchers also commented on the potentia l drawbacks of implementing LLI . These on - site researchers pointed out th at the system can be expensive; requires extensive training; involves a good deal of documentation; and would not be implemented as effectively by less experienced teachers. Finally , some on - group question, stating that their opinion of LLI would depend on who was implementing it. Specifically, these on - site researchers perceived that LLI would only be effec tive if it wa s implemented in small group s by an experienced early childhood teacher with extensive training in LLI. These on - site successful implementation of LLI. Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 53 Conclusions 1. What progress in literacy do students who receive LLI make compared to students who receive only regular classroom literacy instruction? Across the three grade levels, the current study found that LLI positively impacts K - 2 stu dent literacy achievement in rural and suburban settings. Further, we determined that LLI is effective with ELL students , students with a special education designation, and minority students in both rural and suburban settings. Finally, the current study showed that LLI is effective with economically disadvantaged children in both rural and suburban settings. This study found robust effects on the LLI Benchmarks across all grade levels for students who received LLI. Across the three grade levels, studen ts in LLI achieved between 1 ½ benchmark levels up to almost 5 ½ benchmark levels , while students who did not receive LLI achieved between less than 1 benchmark level to 3 benchmark levels. Further, these effects were particularly strong for various sub groups (e.g, ethnicity, special education or ELL status) within each grade level. For k indergarten, significant effects were found, compared to the control group, for African American students, Hispanic students, and ELL students on the LLI Benchmarks, wi th all three subgroups finishing closer to grade level (i.e., Level C ) than their counterparts who finished at or below Level A. 1 st grade African American and Hispanic students in the treatment group also showed more gains than their counterparts in the control group. In 2 nd grade, strong, educationally meaningful effects were found for African American and Hispanic LLI students. 2 nd grade African American LLI students finished at the highest level overall, closely followed by the Hispanic LLI stude nts . Additionally, effects found with the DIBELS measures of reading fluency provided corroboration of the results with the LLI Benchmarks. In k indergarten, students in LLI showed significant gains on subtests of the DIBELS as compared to those who did not have LLI. In particular , for phoneme segmentation fluency, ELL students in the treatment group outperformed ELL students in the control group, as well as non - ELL students in both the treatment and control groups. In 1 st grade, LLI students significantly exceeded the control group on 3 of 4 subtests: nonsense word fluency , letter naming fluency, and oral reading fluency. Finally , on the nonsense word fluency subtest , 1 st grade Hispanic students in the treatment group outperformed their counterparts in the control group. Taken together, all of the student achievement results provide strong evidence that students who are eligible for and participate in LLI make significant progress in literacy compared to students who are eligible to receive LLI and only receive regular classroom literacy instruction. 2. Overall, the observation results from the current study suggest that LLI was implemented with a high degree of fidelity to design across both districts. The majority of lesson components received high fidelity ratings in most of the observations that were conducted. Further, qualitative feedback from the LLI teachers suggests that two of the lesson components receiving lower fidelity ratings the classroom and home connections may have been implemented less frequently due to lack of cooperation or support from parents and lack of familiarity with LLI by the classroom teachers. Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 54 Additionally, observation results revealed that LLI implementation was consistent across the year, with high fidelity scores received at both time points when the observations were conducted. The cores significantly improved from the first observation to the second. Because this scale of the observation tool measured such factors as lesson organization and pacing, the availability of instructional materials, and an overall rating of whether the le sson was delivered as designed, this comfortable with the materials and procedures over time. Finally, the LLI attendance records from the current study revealed that, on average, students instead of 90 for 1 st and 2 nd grade, and approximately 40 days instead of 70 for kindergarten). However, despite receiving les s than the recommended amount of instruction, students in all three grade levels made significant progress in their literacy achievement. This finding suggests that LLI can still be effective during a relatively short er timeframe, which may be valuable to districts with a large number of students to serve or limited time in which to implement early literacy interventions. 3. LLI Overall, the LLI teachers in the current study supported LLI and believed it had a positive impact LLI teachers indicated that they had a good understanding of LLI ; received support in implementing LLI from their district, school administration, and other school staff; and perceived a positive impact on student achievement and student attitudes towards literacy. LLI teachers also reported a positive impact of LLI o n their reading instruction, particularly their understanding of the role of comprehension and phonics/phonemic awareness in the reading process and the relationship of leveled texts to successful reading. LLI teachers were extremely positive about the ma terials and resources, particularly the leveled texts, which they described as high - quality, high - interest, and engaging to students. LLI teachers also liked the small group format of the lessons as well as the well - organized, guided lesson structure. Ho wever, a number of LLI teachers in the current study thought the LLI lessons contained too much information to adequately complete a lesson during the de signated 30 - minute timeframe. Many LLI teachers also thought the system was too fast - paced for their l ower - level students and that there were inconsistencies in materials which made implementation of certain lessons more difficult. In addition to the LLI teachers, a small number of classroom teachers with students in the current study provided feedback on their perceptions of the LLI system . Most of these teachers were positive about LLI le would give up Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) (2009 - 2010 ) 55 Recommendations Altogether , the results from this evaluation allow us to conclude that the LLI system positively impact s studen These results also suggest t hat continued implementation of LLI would be beneficial in both Tift County Schools and the Enlarged City School District of Middletown . While the long - term impacts of LLI have yet to be determined, the positive results found in this evaluation suggest that additional benef its may be seen with the continuation of LLI. This evaluation provided a randomized control led trial and efficacy study for the LLI system as well as offered an opportunity for research - based recommendations that may enhance the system , future research, and ultimately student achievement. From this evaluation, CREP proposes the following recommendations with regard to LLI and its implementation in schools : When possible, schools should begin k indergarten instruction in LLI as soon as p ossible in order to provide the recommended amount of instruction (i.e., 14 weeks) for kindergarten students. Professional development for building principals and central office supervisory staff, although not measured in this study, surfaced as being cr itical to the implementation. Likewise, r egular classroom teacher involvement and professional development to familiarize them with LLI and its features also appears to influence the quality of implementation. LLI teacher professional development shou ld be ongoing with at least a refresher training to supplement and resolve any district - specific issues. Providing scenarios or examples of how prior adopters have developed schedules that allow for full implementation of the 30 - minutes - a - day, five - days - a - week instructional pattern would be helpful to school districts who are new adopters of LLI. Suggestions and recommendations of how LLI teachers might plan and organize their LLI sessions so they can accomplish the instructional goals in a typical 30 - minute session would benefit prior and new adopters of LLI. Additional suggestions from the authors about how best to instruct LLI groups whose members are not at the same level or who have members progressing at a slower rate would be helpf ul. Providing some type of video f or parents of the LLI students could not only explain the system but could provide clips of how they should be working with their child. This is particularly important for the parents of ELL children and the parents of economically disadvantaged children. A careful review of all materials and resources is recommended to ensure consistency and accuracy throughout the system . There is a great need to conduct a similar study in at least one major urban district. Future research of LLI should include l ongitudinal tracking of student reading achievement to look a t the long - term impact of LLI beyond one school year. The LLI benchmarking system would benefit from additional systematic comparisons with other nationally rec ognized literacy assessments.
