This discussion has been prepared by management along with the financial statements and related note disclosures and should be read in conjunction with the financial stateme nts and notes. The financial statements, notes, and this discussion are the responsibility of management. The University has one discretely present ed component unit, the University of Memphis Foundation. More detailed information about the foundation is presented in Note 2 1 to the financial statements. This discussion and analysis focuses on the University a nd does not include the foundation. Overview of the Financial Statements The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which establishes standards for external financial reporting for public colleges and universities. The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis to focus on the single business - type activity, and accordingly, is reported within a single column in the basic financial statements. cial report includes the Statement of Net Position, the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position, and the Statement of Cash Flows. Notes to the financial statements are also presented to provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the financial statements. The Statement of Net Position The Statement of Net Position is a point in time financial statement. The Statement of Net Position presents the financial position of the University at the end of the fiscal year . To aid the reader in determining the ability to meet immediate and future obligations, the statement includes all assets, liabilities, deferred outflows/inflows, and net position of the Univ ersity and segregates the assets and li abilities into current and noncurrent components. Current assets are those that are available to satisfy current liabilities, inclusive of assets that will be converted to cash within one year. Current liabilities are those that will be paid within one year. The Statement of Net Position is prepared under the accrual basis of accounting; assets and liabilities are recognized when goods or services are provided or received despite when cash is actually exchanged. From the data presented, readers of the statement are able to determine the assets available to continue the operations of the University . They are also able to determine how much the University owes vendors , lenders, and others . Net position represents the difference THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 201 4 4 assets and liabilities , along with the difference between deferred outflows and deferred inflows, condition. The Statement of Net Position also indicates the availability of net position for expen diture by the University . Net position is divided into three major categories. The first category, net investment in capital assets , represents the total investment in property, plant, and equipment , net of outstanding debt obligations relat ed to these capital assets. To the extent debt or deferred inflows of resources ha ve been incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are not included. The next category is restricted net position , which is sub - divided into two categories, nonexpendable and expendable. N onexpendable restricted net position includes endowment and similar resources whose use is limited by donors or other outside sources and as a condition of the gift, the principal is to be mainta ined in perpetuity. Expendable restricted net position is available for expenditure by the University but must be spent for purposes as determined by donors and/or external entities that have placed time or purpose restrictions on the use of the resources . The final category is unrestricted net position . Unrestricted net position is available to the University for any lawful purpose of the University . assets, liabilities, deferred outflows/inflows, and net position at June 30, 201 4 , and June 30, 201 3 . THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 201 4 5 Comparison of FY 201 4 to FY 201 3 Current assets decreased primarily due to the reclassification of investments not needed for normal operating expenses within one year to other noncurrent assets. Capital assets increased primarily due to the additional expenditures incurred in the cons truction of the Community Health Building ($13 million) and the New Student Housing facility ($8 million). Current liabilities increased due to $3.5 million accrued expenses for the Community Health Building and the timing of bank transfers for the June 30 payroll tax deposits. Noncurrent liabilities increased primarily due to the addition of $8.6 million in commercial paper to fund the New Student Housing. The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position presents the results of operations for the fiscal year. Revenues and expenses are recognized when earned or incurred, regardless of when cash is received. The statement indicates whether th e financial condition has improved or deteriorated during the fiscal year. The statement presents the revenues received by the University , both operating and nonoperating, and the expenses paid by the University , operating and nonoperating, a nd any other revenues, expenses, gains, or losses received or spent by the University . Generally speaking, operating revenues are received for providing goods and services to the various customers and constituencies of the University . Operating expense s are those expenses paid to acquire or produce the goods and services provided in return for the operating revenues, and to carry out the mission of the University . Nonoperating revenues are revenues received for which goods and services are not provided directly to the payor. Although the University of Memphis is dependent upon state appropriations and gifts to fund educational and general operations, under GASB standards these funding sources are reported as nonoperating revenues, as is investment inco me. As a result, the University has historically reported an excess of operating expenses over operating revenues, resulting in an operating loss financial results for the year. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 201 4 6 ended June 30, 201 4 , and June 30, 201 3 , follows .

Sales and services increased by $2.7 million primarily due to increased athletic conference distributions from the American Athletic Conference , as compared to prior year Conference USA distributions . Au xiliary revenues decreased due a decline in enrollmen t which resulted in a $550,000 decrease in student housing revenue and $140,000 for parking services. Conversion of a building from rental property operations to educational use caused a $400,000 decline in r ental propert y revenues. Operating Expenses Operating expenses may be reported by nature or function. The University has chosen to report the expenses in their natural classification on the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and has displayed the functional classification in the notes to the financial statements. The following summarizes the operating expenses by natural classifications for the last two fiscal years: Comparison of FY 201 4 to FY 201 3 Salaries, wages and benefits expenses increased due to a 1.5% across - the - board pay raise effective July 1, 2013.

Economic Factors That Will Affect the Future In May, 2014, Dr. M. David Rudd began his leadership role at the University of Memphis as the 12th president. He has outlined several key initiatives to improved recruitment, retention, access, completion and overall student success as well as efficiency improvements. We expect these initiatives, over time, to positively impact both enrollment development of on - line courses and the expansion of course offerings at the University of Memphis Lambuth Campus provide significant opportunities for enrollment and revenue growth. the previous year. Although the current year reduction is rel atively small, the cumulative effects of state appropriation reductions are driving the University's effort to reduce the overall budget through restructuring where opportunities exist, position attritions as well as continuing efficiency initiatives. The University reduced its base operating budget by $15M in FY 2014 and plans to further reduce the expenditure base budget by an additional $5M over the next few years. The University opted to reduce the budget in lieu of increasing tuition to students, whi ch enabled tuition to be held flat for FY 2015. We continue to remain cognizant of the impact future tuition increases may have on our students and are committed to minimize tuition increases to the greatest extent possible. We are not aware of any ot her factors, decisions, or conditions that are expected to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operation during this fiscal year.

Although the University does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the F oundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, that the F oundation holds and invests are restricted to the activities of the University by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the F oundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the University , the F oundation is considered a c omponent unit of the University and is discretely presented in the financial statements. See Note 2 1 for more detailed information about the component unit and how to obtain the report.

Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 1 4 27 Funded Status and Funding Progress. The funded status of the plan as of July 1, 201 3 , was as follows: Actuarial valuations involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of events far into the future, and actuarially determined amounts are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared to past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as R equired S upplementary I nformation following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions . Calculations are based on the types of benefits provided under the terms of the substantive plan at the time of each valuation and on the pattern of sharing of costs between the employer and plan members to that point. Actuarial calculations reflect a long - term perspective. Consistent with that perspective, actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce short - term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the ac tuarial value of assets. In the July 1, 201 3 , actuarial valuation, the Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 4. 0 percent investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses) and an annual healthc are cost trend rate of 7.5 percent initially , decreased to 7.0 percent in fiscal year 201 5 and then reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 4.19 percent in fiscal year 20 44 . All rates include a 2.5 percent inflation assumption. The unfunded actuari al accrued liability is being amo rtized as a level percentage of payroll on a closed basis over a 30 year period beginning with July 1, 2007. Payroll is assumed to grow at a rate of 3.0 percent. 1 3 . Chairs of Excellence The U niversity had $ 75,370,455.22 on deposit at June 30, 201 4 , with the State Treasurer for its Chairs of Excellence program. These funds are held in trust by the S tate and are not included in these financial statements. 1 4 . Insurance - Related Activities It is the policy o f the state not to purchase commercial insurance for the risks of losses for general liability, S it is more economical to manage these risks internal ly and set aside assets for claim settlement in its internal service fund, the Risk Management Fund. The S tate purchases commercial insurance for real property (including flood and earthquake) cyber, aircraft, fine arts, and surety bond coverage on the st employees. The amounts of settlements have not exceeded insurance coverage for each of the three past fiscal years. The Risk Management Fund is also responsible for claims for damages to S tate owned property up to the amount of the property insurance aggregate deductible amount. The insurance policy deductibles vary from $25,000 per occurrence, depending on the type of coverage, to an aggregate of $5 million. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 1 4 28 The University participates in the Risk Management Fund. The fund allocates the cost of providing claims servicing and claims payment by charging a premium to the University based on a percentage of the expected loss costs, which include both experience and exposures. This charge considers recent trends in actual claims experience of the state as a whole. An actuarial valuation is performed as of fiscal year - end to determine the fund liability and premium allocation. Information regarding the determination of the clai ms liabilities and the changes in the balances of the claims liabilities for the years ended June 30, 201 3 , and June 30, 201 2 , are presented in the Tennessee Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The CAFR is . Since the University participates in the Risk Management Fund, it is subject to the liability limitations under the provisions of the Tennessee Claims Commission Act, Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 9 - 8 - 101 et seq. Liability for negligence of the University for bodily injury and property damage is limited to $300,000 per person and $1,000,000 per re set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 50 - 6 - The amount of cash and cash equivalents designated for payment of claims held by the Risk Management Fund at June 30, 201 4 , was not available. At June 30, 201 4 , the scheduled coverage for the University was $ 1 ,38 0 , 107 , 4 00 for buildings and $ 3 68, 243 , 7 00 for contents. The S tate has also set aside assets in the Employee Group Insurance Fund, an internal service fund, to provide a program of health insurance cov erage for the employees of the S tate with the risk retained by the S tate. The University participates in the Employee Group Insurance Fund. The fund allocates the cost of providing claims servicing and claims paym ent by charging a premium to the University based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims , including the costs of claims that have been reported but not settled and of claims that have been incurred but not reported. Employees and providers have 13 mo nths to file medical claims. 1 5 . Commitments and Contingencies Sick Leave - The University records the cost of sick leave when paid. Generally, since sick leave (earned one day per month with unlimited accumulation) is paid only when an employee dies o r is absent because of illness, injury, or related family death, there is no liability for sick leave at June 30. The dollar amount of unused sick leave was $ 79 , 235,643.75 at June 30, 201 4 . Operating Leases - The University has entered into various operating leases for buildings and equipment.

Component Unit The University of Memphis Foundation (the Foundation) is a legally separate, 501(c)(3) tax - exempt organization supporting the University of Memphis. The Foundation accepts and manages private support to the University of Memphis to supplement the resources that are availab le to the University in support of its programs. The approximately 40 - member board of the Foundation is self - perpetuating and consists of graduates and friends of the University. Although the University does not control the timing or amount of receipts f rom the Foundation, all resources, or income thereon, that the Foundation holds and invests are to support various activities, programs and endeavors of the University. Because these resources held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the University, the Foundation is considered a During the year ended June 30, 201 4 , the Foundation made distributions of $ 28,157,681 to or on behalf of the University for both restricted and unrestricted purposes.

With the exception of necessary presentation adjustments, no modifications have Universi financial report for these differences. Fair Value Measurements . The F oundation reports certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value has been determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that a re accessible at the measurement date (Level 1), inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability (Level 2), or significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table categorizes the recurring fair value measurements for all investments at June 30, 201 4 : THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 1 4 31 The following table reconciles beginning and ending balance of all investments valued using Level 3 inputs: All gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, have been reported on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position as investment income. Of this total, losses of $ 1, 873 , 073 are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those investments still held at June 30, 201 4 . The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used as of June 30, 201 4 . Money Market funds: Valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Limited Partnerships and LLCs: Limited partnerships and LLC investmen ts are generally valued at the F alue (NAV) of the investee. Some investees invest in equity securities which are valued daily based upon quoted prices in active markets. Certain investees maintain underlying holdings of non - marketable securities whose fair values are estimated by manag ement of the investee. - feed The F oundation values these investments at estimated fair value based upon its equity in the estimated fair value of the i nvestee. These investees are valued at estimated fair value as determined by their management which is based upon the net asset valuations of the underlying investment entities. Fair values for the securities of the underlying investment entities are oft en not readily available and accordingly, the fair values are estimated by management of those entities. Mutual Funds: Valued at quoted market price s which are based upon the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the F oundation at year - end. U.S. government securities and corporate bonds: Valued at quoted market prices or valuations provided by commercial pricing services or the mean of the bid and ask prices provided by investment brokers. The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although management believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 1 4 32 methodo logies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Cash Cash c onsists of demand deposit accounts. The bank balances at June 30, 201 4 , were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 and the excess was fully collateralized . Investments Investments are reco rded on the date of acquisition and are stated at market value. Unrealized gains and losses are determined by the difference between market values at the beginning and end of the year. Investment securities held at year - end were as follows: Alternative Investments - The F oundation has certain limited partnership/LLC investments that are classified for fair value measurement purposes as Level 3 . The estimated fair value of these assets is $ 86,220,046 at June 30, 201 4 . The Foundation believes that the carrying amount of such alternative investments is a reasonable estimate of fair value as of June 30, 201 4 . Because these investments are not readily marketable, the estimated value is subject to uncertainty and, therefore, may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and such differences could be material. These investments are made in accordance order to achieve an appropriate level of diversification. These investments are designed to enhance diversification and provide red uctions in overall portfolio volatility. The fair values are estimated by the Pledges Receivable - Pledges r eceivable are summarized below net of the allowance for doubtful accounts: Capital Assets The University of Memphis Foundation had art and historical collections valued at $596,228 at June 30, 2014. Endowments T he University of Memphis wment consists of approximately 4 7 0 individual funds established for a variety of purposes. Its endowment includes both donor - restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by GAAP, Net Position associated with endowment fun ds, including funds designated by the Board of THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 1 4 33 Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor - imposed restrictions. Interpretation of Relevant Law The Board of Trustees of the University of Memp his Foundation has interpreted the Uniform Prudent Ma nagement of Institutional Funds Act (the Act) as adopted by Tennessee as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor - restricted endowment funds abse nt explicit donor stipulations to the contrary . As a result of this interpretation, the Foundation classifies as permanently restricted Net Position (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent g ifts to the permanent endowment, (c) any donor specified accumulations to the permanent endowment funds made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument. The remaining portion of the donor - restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted Net Position is classified as temporarily restricted Net Position until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the F oundation in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by the Act. In a ccordance with the Act, the F oundation considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor - restricted endowment funds: 1. The duration and preservation of the fund 2. The purposes of the F oundation and the endowment fund 3. General economic conditions 4. The possible effect of inflation or deflation 5. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 6. Other resources of the F oundation 7. The investment policies of the F oundation THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 1 4 34 Funds with Deficiencies From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individ ual donor restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the F oundation is required to retain in a fund of perpetual duration. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles , deficiencies of this nature are reported in unrestricted Net Position . These deficiencies resulted from unfavorable market fluctuations that occurred after the investment of permanently restricted contributions and/or continued appropriation for fees an d expenditures. At June 30, 201 4 , deficiencies of this nature totaled $ 2 45, 938 . Return Objectives and Risk Parameters The F oundation has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment as sets include those assets of donor - restricted funds that the organization must hold in perpetuity or for a donor - specified period(s) as well as board - designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are inves ted in a manner that is intended to produce consistent long - term growth of capital without undue market cycle of at least 6 % over the inflation rate. A market cycle shall generally be considered to be a three to five year period. Actual returns may vary from the total return objective. Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives To satisfy its long - term rate - of - return objectives, the Foundation reli es on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The Foundation targets a diversified asset allocation that places a significant emphasis on equity - based investments to achieve its long - term return objectives within prudent risk restraints. Spending Policy and How the Investment Objectives Relate The Foundation has a policy of budgeting (appropriating) for expenditure each year a percentage of its - end one year prece d ing the fiscal year in which the expenditure is planned. For fiscal year 201 4 this percentage was three point seven five percen t ( 3 .75%). In establishing this policy, the Foundation considered the long - term expected return on its endowment funds. Accordingly, over the long - term, the Foundation expects the current spending policy to allow for endowment growth. This is consistent to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts and investment return.
