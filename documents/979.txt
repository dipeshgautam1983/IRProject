Program objectives for the B.F.A. in Art are: (a) to develop a B.F.A. student who is capable of critical and analytical reasoning as a practicing art professional; (b) to provide students with a foundation for graduate or professional education; (c) to prepare students to join the community of artists at the local, national and international levels; (d) to acquire the knowledge to work comprehensively in the discipline or related discipline. The Department of Art welcomes qualified individuals who aspire to become practicing artists and designers. Professional art and design education is available in four concentration options: (1) Art Education; (2) Studio Arts; (3) Graphic Design; (4) Photography. The Department also welcomes students considering a minor in Art or in Photography. Please see the Minors section following the listing of concentration requirements for the B.F.A. in Art. Special requirements for the Art major are divided into five groups: general education foundation in art art history concentration area electives to bring the total credit hours to 120 hours. Advanced Placement Credit: Prior to registration, Advanced Placement portfolios should be reviewed in the Department of Art for consistency with the performance standards required of enrolled students. An A.P. portfolio with a score of three (3), four (4), or five (5) points on the General Portfolio or on the Drawing Portfolio will be reviewed for the possible award of three credit hours. If a student submits separate portfolios from the junior and senior years, a maximum of six credit hours may be awarded. For a grade of three (3) points on the Drawing Portfolio or three (3), four (4), or five (5) points on the General Portfolio, three hours of unassigned studio elective credit may be awarded. For a grade of four (4) or five (5) points in the Drawing Portfolio, three hours of credit in Art 1311 (Beginning Drawing) will be considered. Unassigned A.P. credit may be used to satisfy a University credit. Advising: Student advising in the Department of Art is an essential support service that aids students in clarifying academic goals consistent with their interests, abilities, and resources. Academic advisors assist Art majors in the selection of appropriate courses and provide meaningful discussion regarding career goals, past academic experience, and future academic progress. Freshmen, transfer and returning students are encouraged to contact the Art Office (room 201, Jones Hall) to request an academic advisor. Assistance from an advisor does not relieve a student of the responsibility of studying the appropriate catalog (Catalog) and fulfilling all degree requirements. Transfer students with more that 40 semester hours should see the CCFA Graduation Analyst (room 232, CFA Building) before seeing an Art advisor. Before taking courses from another institution intended to apply towards the University of Memphis graduation, the student must obtain permission from the CCFA Dean. Art (B.F.A.) A.
