Internships Student Employer Faculty Internship Guidelines Events Contact Us Student Guide Campus Resources Internship Opportunities University Internship Programs Home Internships Student Guide Academic Credit Academic Credit for Internship Experience If you are interested in receiving academic credit for an internship experience, first consult with your academic advisor. If your department does not offer academic credit for an internship experience, or you are maxed out on your internship hours within your major, you may choose to enroll in ELC 4000-Community Internship course that is available for all majors. * Beginning Fall 2015, UNIV 4000 is now identified as ELC 4000. Please be mindful of this change in all course listings that should now identify the course under Experiential Learning Credit (ELC). ELC 4000 - Community Internship (3-6 semester hours) offers extensive professional preparation as an intern in a community setting that may limit student's enrollment in other courses. Prerequisite: - Permission of student's academic advisor (denoted by signature on internship contract) - Internship offer letter and/or position description - Academic Good Standing Note: Students enrolled in ELC 4000 are considered to be full time students for enrollment certification purposes. If you have questions concerning your eligibility for aid, please contact DebraAnn Brown, Associate Director, Financial Aid and Scholarships at dbrown@memphis.edu . Download an overview of ELC 4000 here. The completed learning contract must be approved by your internship site supervisor and your academic advisor. Once these documents have been reviewed and approved, you will then receive a permit to register for ELC 4000. To request a leave of absence, submit a Personal or Medical Leave of Absence Request form and supporting documents to the Scholarship Office in 201 Wilder Tower. For additional information regarding ELC 4000 contact Academic Internships at acadinterns@memphis.edu or 901-678-3260.
