As I mentioned in my last email, this new minimum represents a 14% increase for some of our lowest paid employees and is over 28% higher than the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.  As a reminder, all employees will continue to receive longevity pay between $300 and $3,000 per year, based on their years of service to the University of Memphis and the State of Tennessee, adding to their overall earnings at the University. I want to thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to the University of Memphis.  Because of all of you, our students receive a quality education in an environment that fosters collaboration and excellence. I look forward to the exciting opportunities that await us in 2015. Regards, M.

The Pell vs. non-Pell gaps in first to second year retention rates for low-income freshman, low-income transfers, underrepresented minority (URM) freshman and underrepresented minority  transfers all improved significantly and in some cases the gaps were closed.  From 2006 to date, the retention rates for low-income freshman receiving Pell support have increased from 69% to 73% and for low-income transfers the rates for Pell recipients have increased from 67% to 73%.  For URM Pell recipients during the same time period, rates have increased from 70% to 74% and for URM transfer Pell recipients they have improved from 65% to 73%. Again, the comparisons with non-Pell recipients demonstrate the gap has been closed for low-income transfers and URM transfers, and the gap narrowed for freshman in both groups. Data on the six-year graduation rates show noticeable improvement across both Pell and non-Pell groups, but naturally take longer to demonstrate the kind of progress we have targeted.  Both Pell and non-Pell low-income freshman graduation rates have improved, from 35% to 50% and 25% to 33%, respectively.  Low income transfers for non-Pell recipients have improved from 36% to 52% and Pell recipients have  moved from 39% to 43%.  URM freshman with Pell support have improved from 26% to 35%, and those without Pell support going from 36% to 49%.  Finally, URM transfers students with Pell support have gone from 32% to 40% and non-Pell URM transfer students have improved dramatically from 39% to 55%. It takes an entire campus community to have this kind of remarkable impact, particularly over such a brief period of time.  Join me in thanking all of those in academic affairs for this great progress, but it is only with the support of all of our faculty and staff across the entire campus that this kind of progress is possible.  Thank you and congratulations for helping change the lives of our students and for having such a positive impact on our community, state and nation.
