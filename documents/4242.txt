We have expended considerable effort over the past two years to expand and enhance our assessment efforts, to increase our accessibility and resources targeting student success.  This year’s score indicates clear and steady progress. In addition to a note of thanks, we’d also like to raise the bar. The University of Memphis offers an exceptional educational experience and we both believe that quality should be routinely reflected in a performance funding score of 95 or above.  We are in the process of establishing an Institutional Effectiveness Council, a group that will coordinate all of our assessment, accreditation, and related performance outcomes efforts. This will allow for coordinated and seamless integration of university-wide strategic planning, THEC, SACSCOC and other accreditation demands, along with helping us achieve optimal performance as an institution. We will keep you updated as the Council is launched in the coming weeks. Thank you for your hard work and expertise.  We’re making noticeable progress, progress that is critical to the lives of our students and the broader Memphis community. Warm Regards, M.
