Artwork from children was incorporated into the presentation as an essential way to work with children who often don’t have the words to describe their experiences and feelings. Social workers in Memphis regularly work with families affected by multiple forms of violence. Melissa stated, “It’s not uncommon for kids to tell me they sleep on the floor so the bullets don’t get them.” She then explained that, Domestic Violence isn’t the only type of violence kids are exposed to. “Often, it’s general environmental issues. Kids live with a general lack of hope for the future and don’t see anything different. “ For this reas on, its important to focus on their individual strengths and approach all interventions using trauma informed care models. Programs and resources available through the Exchange Club Family Center of the Mid -South were also discussed. Their mission is to b reak the cycle of child abuse and neglect by replacing abusive and violent behaviors with effective parenting skills. As such, they offer a large assortment of programs that target three major areas 1.) Child abuse and family violence, 2.) Parenting educa tion, and 3.) Anger management. Students left the experience with a greater understanding about how to help children and families across all social work subspecialties. One student said, “even if you work in an area not generally associated with violenc e, you’ll see the aftermath of violence everyday.” Another student said, “There is no way we can be effective social workers without understanding violence and how to implement models of trauma informed care.” More information about the Exchange Club Fami ly Center can be found here: . 1Two therapists from the Exchange Club Family Center of the Mid -South spoke to the Second Year MSW students about the devastating affects that exposure to violence and trauma has on families in Memphis and the Mid -South. Melissa Farrar and David Frankel used real world examples to help students better understand how the intersection of child abuse, intimate partner violence, and community violence affects all aspects of social work practice. When working in Memphis and the Mid -South, the importance of understanding violence is considerably different than it is elsewhe re. Violence is an everyday part of life that social workers need to understand and address across all levels of practice. To illustrate these factors, the speakers began their presentation with an experiential learning activity illustrating the difficulties people in the Memphis community face when seeking support for concerns stemming from violence. Developed from statements made by actual clients, the activity brought to life how difficult it is for clients to escape the violence that permeates all aspects of their world. From this experie nce, the importance of trauma informed care was emphasized. Indeed, the pervasive harms associated with violence and trauma generally manifest as emotional, physical, spiritual, and behavior problems across multiple life domains. Although such problems a re evident in both adults and children, Melissa and David focused most of their talk on the unique experiences of children and evidence -based interventions that are helpful. Students were exposed to three primary modes of intervention with children: group therapy, play therapy, and art therapy. Melissa Farrar stated, “Group therapy is a highly effective approach because it emphasizes relationships and teaches the Submission by Dr. Catherine Simmons, Associate Professor 8 MARCH 2014 UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHI S DEPARTMENT OF SOCI AL WORK Upcoming Trainings and Events 2who are beginning a new non -profit organization .
