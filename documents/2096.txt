Engineering Technology education focuses primarily on the applied aspects of science and that portion of the technological spectrum closest to product improvement, industrial practices, and engineering operation functions. The educational objectives of the Engineering Technology program are to produce graduates who are prepared to: 1. Attain gainful employment in a related technical field providing personal and professional growth; 2. Pursue professional development such as additional formal education, certifications and workshops; 3. Attain increasing levels of responsibility and leadership in their own chosen field; 4. Apply a depth of knowledge and ability to manage, design, develop, analyze, and/or implement technical projects, demonstrating a quality of performance necessary to succeed in engineering technology careers. Graduates are referred to as Engineering Technologists and work as members of the engineering team focusing primarily on the implementation of new technologies. Students will select two fields of study providing depth in subjects of interest to them. Technical electives will provide breadth of study that supports their general knowledge base. Within the core are courses that prepare students to manage people and projects as they grow in their career. Graduates of this program are employed in the areas of quality assurance, product/software support, applied design and development, manufacturing support. plant management, computerized process control, systems planning, process planning, supervision and technical sales. ADMISSION: Before a student can declare the Engineering Technology major, the student must have earned: 1) a grade of at least "C" for each of the following 9 courses (or equivalents), and 2) a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 for these courses. MATH 1910 Calculus I PHYS 2010 General Physics I / Trig PHYS 2011 General Physics I Lab TECH 1411 Introduction to Technology TECH 1010 Computer Applications in Technology TECH 1521 Graphics and Descriptive Geometry TECH (EETH) 1811 Electronic Circuit Technology TECH (CETH) 1211 Computer Programming TECH (METH) 1711 Manufacturing Processes I Until both of these criteria are satisfied, students admitted to the University and wishing to declare the Engineering Technology major will be coded as Pre-Engineering Technology. Transfer students will be coded as Pre-Engineering Technology for a minimum of one semester following admission to the University of Memphis. They may declare the Engineering Technology major upon completion of the Admission requirements. A student may not register for upper-division courses in TECH (formerly CETH, EETH, or METH) at or above the 3000 level without being declared as an Engineering Technology major. Exceptions to the Admission criteria are at the discretion of the Department Chair. GRADUATION: To qualify for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology, the student must satisfy University and College requirements, and obtain a 2.0 grade point average on all work completed, and obtain a minimum grade of "C" in all engineering technology and mathematics courses used to satisfy degree requirements. A grade of "C" or better is also required in ENGL 3603. Engineering Technology (B.S.E.T.) A.

Program in Engineering Technology This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Science in Engineering Technology during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.S.E.T./M.S. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Engineering Technology. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.S.E.T. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.S. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Engineering Technology department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in engineering technology. Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.S.E.T./M.S. program, which allows them to take graduate courses in engineering technology. To continue in the program past the B.S.E.t., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the Engineering Technology department's M.S. program. Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply to undergraduate GPA.
