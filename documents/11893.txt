Plagiarism in Economics WALTER ENDERS and GARY A. HOOVER1 "When you stealfrom one author, it's plagiarism; if you stealfrom many, it's research."2 1. Introduction In this paper, we report the results of a sur- vey concerning the nature and the extent of plagiarism in the economics profession. Perhaps more importantly, we report on the practices and policies that professional jour- nals use to curb plagiarism. The motivation for the paper can be understood by reading the following verbatim excerpts from a set of e-mail communications between one author of this paper and the editor of a well-known economics journal. The discussion concerned a referee report that the author was prepar- ing for the editor. In order to provide confi- dentiality, the names have been removed and are indicated by a set of brackets [ ]. Author (2/7/2003): "As it turns out, some of the wording is remarkably similar to a paper I have written. ... As such, I am not sure how to proceed with my review. I have attached my paper in Word format. ... If you think the papers are sufficiently dissXimilar, I will send my review." Editor (2/7/2003): "It appears to be a pretty clear-cut case of plagiarism. ... Apart from rejecting the manuscript and refusing any future submissions from the author, I am not sure how I should proceed." Author (2/10/2003): " ... A simple rejec- tion along with a refusal to consider future papers is not sufficient. No one would allow similar behavior from a student to go unchecked. We don't want to see this turn into a major issue. However, we request that you send a copy of your rejection letter (along with both papers) to [the plagiarizer's dean]." Editor (2/12/2003): "I respect your views and agree that some further steps are called for. I want to seek some outside counsel as well before proceeding. Can you please give me ten days or so to get some additional input?" Editor (2/14/03): "I have received input from our advisory panel and several col- leagues. They and I both are concerned about possible liability for the journal of any aggressive course of action. Without further investigation, though, I would not be ready to make the same conclusion regarding infor- mation that might ruin someone's career." The correspondence ended when Author received a CC copy of an e-mail from the editor to the plagiarizer (2/14/2003): "Dear [plagiarizer]," "Thank you very much for your submis- sion. Unfortunately, after careful review, we have decided that we cannot accept [the 1 University of Alabama, Department of Economics, Finance, and Legal Studies. 2 Wilson Izner (1876-1933), Bartlett's Familiar Quotations 757 (15th ed. 1980). 487 This content downloaded from 38.81.176.126 on Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:50:42 PMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 488 Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLII (June 2004) paper] for publication in [journal]. We appreciate having had the opportunity to consider your work and hope that you con- sider our journal for future submissions." Notice that it was the editor who first used the term "plagiarism" and that the ini- tial intent of the editor was to impose a penalty on the plagiarizer. The fear of litiga- tion and the possibility of damaging a career, however, ultimately altered the decision. These events led us to investigate the extent of similar occurrences in the econom- ics profession. As such, in April of 2003, we sent out approximately 470 surveys to the editors (or co-editors) of various journals that economists use as outlets for their work. The cover letter gave the editors the option of completing the survey online or using the paper survey that was enclosed. Approximately 42 percent of respondents filled out the survey online. In all, we received useable responses from 130 jour- nals, for a response rate of about 28 percent. Some of the best-known and respected jour- nals are included, along with smaller, more field-specific journals. The list of respon- dents includes the American Economic Review, Journal of Economic Literature, Journal of Finance, and Journal of the American Statistical Association. The com- plete list of responding journals is available at . e-JEL. org or . cba.ua. edu/-ghoover, while the questionnaire appears in the article appendix. 2. Formal Plagiarism Policies One of our concerns was whether jour- nals had formal policies in place regarding plagiarism. Of the 127 journal editors who responded to this question, only 24 (19 per- cent) reported that they had a formal policy. The Taylor & Francis Copyright Agreement (2003) is quite representative of most policies: You warrant that, apart from any such third party copyright material included in the Article, the Article is your original work, and does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any other person or entity and cannot be construed as plagiarizing any other published work. The most common response of those with- out a formal policy was that the copyright agreement signed by prospective authors implicitly certified the originality of the work. For example, the Kluwer Academic Publishers Consent to Publish and Transfer Copyright (2003) agreement states that the author warrants that the Article is original work and has not been published before in any form and that it does not infringe upon any copyright, con- tains no libelous or otherwise unlawful state- ments, and does not otherwise infringe on the rights of others, and that any necessary permis- sion to quote from another source has been obtained .... The most common reason given by those without a formal policy was that they never encountered a case of plagiarism and there- fore found a policy to be unnecessary. One editor stated that "publishing a plagiarism pol- icy suggests that the editors treat the potential contributors as potential cheaters and primi- tives in general. Not a very polite attitude towards contributors." Another editor stated: When I invite a guest to my home, I do not post a sign that shouts at them that removing the sil- verware is stealing and will be prosecuted according to the law. The reason I do not do this has to do with the high quality of the people that I invite to my home. Similarly, the [Journal] is a refereed professional journal. Warning a profes- sor of economics about plagiarism would seem to be an insult and most professors who corre- spond with me would say so without hesitation. Nevertheless, few professors would dis- tribute a class syllabus without a statement of appropriate student conduct and an enu- meration of the penalties for plagiarism. A third editor responded that contributors are hesitant to plagiarize because they would be detected: "In my experience, it is rare. The review process is quite deliberate (and This content downloaded from 38.81.176.126 on Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:50:42 PMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Enders and Hoover: Plagiarism in Economics 489 TABLE 1 WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING CONSTITUTE PLAGIARISM?

We should note that warranty and indem- nity clauses, as in the Kluwer Academic Publishers contract above, allow publishers to sue plagiarizers for breach of contract and/or fraud. We were not able to find a single instance of such an occurrence. Moreover, since the copyright is held by the publisher, the actual author has little legal ground for such a suit should they seek redress against a plagiarizer. In summary, although editors seem con- cerned about plagiarism, few have any for- mal plagiarism policy. Instead, they tend to rely on copyright law to protect themselves from unauthorized duplication of published materials. To be fair, most journals do try to protect themselves from plagiarism. However, there is an important distinction between plagiarism and copyright violation. The Modern Language Association's Style Guide (see Joseph Gibaldi 1998, p. 151) states: "Using another person's ideas or expressions in your writing without acknowl- edging the source constitutes plagiarism." Since ideas, principles, concepts, and dis- coveries are not protected under U.S. copy- right law, plagiarism need not involve copyright infringement. As such, copyright law provides no protection for the original innovator of an idea even though the theft of an idea is clearly plagiarism. 3. The Nature and Extent of Plagiarism The editors indicated a surprisingly small number of plagiarism cases. Of the 117 editors that responded to the question, 83 editors (nearly 71 percent) said that they see zero cases of plagiarism in a typi- cal year. Of the remainder, 28 editors reported one case, four reported two cases, and two reported three or more cases of plagiarism in a typical year. Hence, the edi- tors reported 42 occurrences of plagiarism in an average year. Of course, an important factor in the num- ber of reported occurrences is editors' per- ceptions of the appropriate definition of plagiarism. The editors' responses are reported in table 1. There are several key features to note in the response pattern. While not unanimous, the large majority of responding editors con- sidered the use of several unattributed sen- tences or a proof to be plagiarism. Most also thought that the use of privately collected data without permission constituted plagia- rism. One dissenting editor noted that, if the data were effectively in the public domain, it This content downloaded from 38.81.176.126 on Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:50:42 PMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 490 Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLII (June 2004) TABLE 2 IN A CLEAR CASE OF PLAGIARISM, WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING ARE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES?

The editors were almost evenly split, however, on the use of an unattributed idea. There is no question that it can be more dif- ficult to detect the use of an unattributed idea than unattributed sentences or equa- tions. In fact, one editor expressed the pos- sibility that an author may hear an idea and later develop papers without knowing where the idea came from. Nevertheless, the passing off of another's idea as original is clearly plagiarism. As mentioned earlier, ideas can be plagia- rized without a copyright violation. Hence, copyright law provides no protection from someone plagiarizing an idea heard at a con- ference or seminar or read on a website. The copyright agreements provided by the jour- nals are simply copyright transfers from authors to publishers. As plagiarism can occur without copyright violation, copyright infringement can occur without plagiarism. In fact, several editors wrote that they were concerned about authors submitting a work that is essentially the same as another paper that they have already published. A related issue was that of simultaneous submissions of similar papers. These are clearly issues of copyright violation since, by definition, it is not possible to plagiarize yourself. Similarly, a few editors noted the possibility of senior faculty members exploiting the work of grad- uate students or adding their name to a paper without making a substantive contri- bution to the work. John List et al. (2001) found that thirteen percent of the American Economic Association members responding to their survey believe that the research con- tained in the top thirty journals involves this type of plagiarism. 4. Responses to Plagiarism Table 2 reports what the editors deem to be appropriate responses to a clear case of plagiarism. Notice that 99 of the 110 responding editors stated that they would likely or definitely inform the original author of plagiarism if it were possible. Unlike our experience with [editor] men- tioned earlier, almost 78 percent of responding editors would ban future sub- missions to the journal from a plagiarist. In fact, three editors noted that their journals keep logs of plagiarists; hence, the ban on submissions exceeds the stewardship of an editor. On the other hand, less than half of responding editors would publicize the incident or notify the plagiarist's superior. Some editors noted that banning plagia- rists from future submissions and making a public notice would be appropriate if the paper was discovered to have contained pla- giarized material after it had already been This content downloaded from 38.81.176.126 on Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:50:42 PMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Enders and Hoover: Plagiarism in Economics 491 printed. Moreover, there have been a few public notices of jlagiarism appearing in economics journals. Naturally, plagiarism policies are influ- enced by potential litigation. Initially, [edi- tor] was willing to ban our plagiarist from future submissions to the journal. Recall that he later suggested that potential litigation influenced the journal's response to the pla- giarism. Of the 114 editors responding to question 7 of our survey, forty (35.1 percent) indicated that their behavior towards plagia- rism is somewhat influenced by the potential for litigation, and five (4.4 percent) indicated that the potential for litigation greatly influ- ences their behavior regarding plagiarism. One editor replied that his journal has an insurance policy to help pay legal costs if the journal is sued. Sixty-nine (60.5 percent) replied that their behavior towards plagiarism is not at all influenced by the threat of potential litiga- tion. Since 57 of these editors have no formal plagiarism policy, it is possible that some would recant when faced with a similar instance of plagiarism. One editor, however, was very clear that his journal has taken very aggressive stances against plagiarism: "We have had two incidents in the last two years. One constituted deliberate, premeditated plagiarism, in our view. We reported the case to the institution employing the perpetrator." The plagiarist was fired. 5. Policies to Combat Plagiarism The question eliciting the strongest opin- ions asked editors if they favored a code of ethics for the economics profession. Professional organizations involved with licensure and/or certification typically have an explicit code of ethics. Of the 111 editors responding to this question, 73 (65.8 per- cent) reported that the economics profes- sion would benefit from such a code. Dissenting editors indicated that "a code of ethics is a good idea but would do nothing to curb plagiarism because it would be 'pro forma' and unenforceable." Another indicat- ed that a code "is not applicable to econom- ics the way it would be for biochemists or accountants." Even in the presence of a code, plagiarism can be difficult to detect. A clever plagia- rizer of an idea will not use the exact word- ing of the original paper. For example, Laura Miller (2003) discusses the complexities of Lewis Perdue's legal case against Dan Brown (author of the recent best-seller The Da Vinci Code). Perdue's Daughter of God and The Da Vinci Code both involve Vatican intrigue, hidden manuscripts, and clues that are hidden in paintings. The issue is compli- cated by the fact that many economists work on "timely" topics, so that several people can be working on the same idea simultaneous- ly. A famous example is the publication of Stanley Fischer (1977) and Edmund Phelps and John Taylor (1977) in the same issue of the Journal of Political Economy. Each paper acknowledges the others' independ- ent formalization of the notion that stag- gered wage contracts allow the monetary authorities to stabilize the economy using a feedback rule. Although the editors of 117 journals report a minimum of 42 instances of plagia- rism per year, the number is certainly small relative to the total number of submissions. Our conjecture is that reputation effects deter many potential plagiarists. Certainly, blatant plagiarism is easily detected and can destroy the plagiarist's reputation. Yet, our plagiarist did not have a national reputation, was from a medium-sized college, and prob- ably wanted an additional publication to help insure promotion from associate to full pro- fessor. As such, it is troubling that 53 percent of the majority of journal editors are not will- ing to report a clear case of plagiarism pub- licly or to inform the plagiarist's chair, dean, or provost. A second conjecture is that short- ening the time between manuscript submis- sion and eventual publication would reduce 3 See KYKLOS (1999) and Quarterly Journal of Economics (1984).

The longer an article circulates in mimeo form with limited distribution, the greater the likelihood of someone deliberately (or inadvertently) incorporating key features of the paper. 6. Conclusions It could be argued that potential plagia- rists are less likely to submit an article to a well-known journal. We used an ad hoc method of selecting twenty well-known U.S.-based and international journals from our list of respondents. The responses from this set are very similar to those of the entire sample. Where there are differences, editors from the list of twenty experience a bit less plagiarism and are less inclined to a code of ethics. The key findings from our survey are: 1. Editors tend to rely on copyright law to protect themselves from unauthorized duplication of published materials. As such, there is little protection for the innovator of an idea presented at a conference, contained in a student's paper, or posted on the web. Moreover, the editors were almost evenly split on the notion that the use of an unat- tributed idea constitutes plagiarism. Thus, the relatively small number of reported instances is less than the actual number of occurrences. 2. The majority of editors are not likely to publicize an instance of plagiarism. About thirty percent of the editors would be willing to publish such a notice and only 47 percent are likely to notify the plagia- rist's superior. Thus, for the majority of journals, the penalty for plagiarism is a ban on future submissions and notification of the actual author. 3. A reasonable majority of editors (73 out of 111) favor a code of ethics for the eco- nomics profession. A few editors attributed some forms of plagiarism to poor training and mentoring by advisors and senior col- leagues. Enumeration of the various forms of plagiarism and the appropriate penalties could aid potential authors and provide edi- tors with behavioral guidelines if they detect plagiarism. A code could also help journal editors in any potential litigation arising from an attempt to impose sanctions on plagiarists. REFERENCES Fischer, Stanley. 1977.
