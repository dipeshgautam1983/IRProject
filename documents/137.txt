Final Notebook : A set of applications, demonstrating your knowledge of statistics All sections will be app lications related to education See Course Orientation PPT for details In-class problems: During many classes, students will be required to create an application of some concept to a scenario given in class. The student will describe a problem, as well as identify the reason why such information might be important. These will be turned in after 5 -10 minutes. Daily Feedback : Within 24 hours of the end of each class, each student will submit a feedback email; taken together, these sheets will provide inf ormation on guiding the next class meeting. Friday Assignments: Most Fridays will be non -lecture. Students will come to class and generally be presented with a task to be completed during the class time. These are intended to reinforce the topics pres ented during the week and/or develop critical thinking skills. Projects: The best way to learn statistics is by doing. At various points throughout the semester, you™ll be required to get out and do some work. This may, for instance, involve a visit to a fast -food restaurant, collecting data. PARTICIPATION & ATTENDANCE Class attendance and participation are expected. The technical nature and organization of the course require your maximum participation in class discussions and activities. Active parti cipation of students in all class discussions are expected and encouraged by the above grading method. Topics may be presented that are not within the textbook. A substantial portion of this class is intended to foster learning through discussion. Part icipation can add to your course grade by positive participation in class; or it can be a negative impact on your grade, if your in -class actions are disruptive. ACCOMODATIONS Note: Reasonable and appropriate accommodations will be provided to students with disabilities who present a memo from Student Disability Services (SDS). Students who request disability accommodations without a memo must first go to SDS. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY All students are expected to submit work that is their own.
