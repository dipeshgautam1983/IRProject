It is important to make two points. First, these recommendations have to be approved by the Legislature and endorsed by the Governor.  Second, although remarkably helpful they do not resolve our continuing efforts to close structural budget problems that have endured for years. I will continue to keep you fully updated as we move forward in the legislative session.  In addition to the THEC recommendations, we have made a number of supplemental funding requests for the UofM. Thank you for your hard work and dedication to our students, research mission, and community. We are seeing some meaningful progress and the promise of good days ahead. Thank you, M. David Rudd | President Leave a comment | Nov 02 2015 Doing is Preserving Posted by Jeanine Hornish Rakow At the UofM, we believe in bold ideas that become motors for change. Our University is home to the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change, where we work toward a more just society in ways that lead others to join us. By watching this video, you’ll learn about this critical work and a student who is infusing new energy into solving society’s most pressing racial issues. It only takes a few minutes to watch, and it’s a true reflection of how we are a university that is Driven by Doing. Sincerely, M. David Rudd | President Leave a comment | Nov 02 2015 In Memory of U.S. Senator Fred Thompson Posted by Jeanine Hornish Rakow Dear Campus Community: The University of Memphis extends its sympathies on the death of former U.S. senator and Republican presidential candidate Fred Dalton Thompson, who passed away yesterday. Mr. Thompson was an alumnus and longtime friend of the University of Memphis, earning a bachelor&#8217;s degree in political science in 1964. He received the University’s Distinguished Alumni Award in 1996. Fred Thompson served our University, state and country with great distinction. We are deeply saddened by this loss and will forever benefit from the good work completed by this great alumnus and Tennessean. Mr. Thompson, who grew up in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, was widely respected for his dedication to public service. His career placed him squarely in pivotal moments in Tennessee and U.S. history. He rose to fame as an attorney during the Watergate hearings. He served as a senator from 1994 to 2003 before launching a brief run for the presidency in 2008. With a commanding voice, he starred in numerous films and television series, including &#8220;The Hunt for Red October,&#8221; &#8220;No Way Out&#8221; and &#8220;Law &amp; Order.&#8221; By order of the Governor, flags over the State Capitol and all State office buildings shall be flown at half-staff in memory of Senator Fred Thompson.  Flags shall be lowered effective immediately until sunset on Tuesday, November 3, 2015.
