This discussion has been prepared by management along with the financial statements and related note disclosures and should be read in conjunction with the financial stateme nts and notes. The financial statements, notes, and this discussion are the responsibility of management. The University has one discretely present ed component unit, the University of Memphis Foundation. More detailed information about the foundation is presented in Note 22 to the financial statements. This discussion and analysis focuses on the University a nd does not include the foundation. Overview of the Financial Statements The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which establishes standards for external financial reporting for public colleges and universities. The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis to focus on the single business - type activity, and accordingly, is reported within a single column in the basic financial statements. cial report includes the Statement of Net Position, the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position, and the Statement of Cash Flows. Notes to the financial statements are also presented to provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the financial statements. The Statement of Net Position The Statement of Net Position is a point in time financial statement. The Statement of Net Position presents the financial position of the University at the end of the fiscal year . To aid the reader in determining the ability to meet immediate and future obligations, the statement includes all assets, liabilities, deferred outflows/inflows, and net position of the Univ ersity and segregates the assets and li abilities into current and noncurrent components. Current assets are those that are available to satisfy current liabilities, inclusive of assets that will be converted to cash within one year. Current liabilities are those that will be paid within one y ear. The Statement of Net Position is prepared under the accrual basis of accounting; assets and liabilities are recognized when goods or services are provided or received despite when cash is actually exchanged. From the data presented, readers of the statement are able to determine the assets available to continue the operations of the University . They are also able to determine how much the University owes vendors , lenders, and others . Net position represents the difference THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2013 4 assets and liabilities , along with the difference between deferred outflows and deferred inflows, condition. The Statement of Net Position also indicates th e availability of net position for expenditure by the University . Net position is divided into three major categories. The first category, net investment in capital assets , represents the total investment in property, plant, and equipment , n et of outstanding debt obligations related to these capital assets. To the extent debt or deferred inflows of resources ha ve been incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are not included. The next category is restricted net position , which is sub - divided into two categories, nonexpendable and expendable. N onexpendable restricted net position includes endowment and similar resources whose use is limited by donors or other outside sources and as a condition of the gift, the pr incipal is to be maintained in perpetuity. Expendable restricted net position is available for expenditure by the University but must be spent for purposes as determined by donors and/or external entities that have placed time or purpose restrictions on t he use of the resources . The final category is unrestricted net position . Unrestricted net position is available to the University for any lawful purpose of the University . assets, liabilities, deferred ou tflows/inflows, and net position at June 30, 2013, and June 30, 2012. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2013 5 Comparison of FY 2013 to FY 2012 Current Assets decreased primarily due to the sale of US Government Securities of $10 million which was used to fund capital projects. On August 1, 2012, the State issued revenue bonds to advance refu nd fo u r outstanding bond issues. Although t he defeased bond on the University Service Court resulted in a loss that the University deferred and amortized over 13 years , the University in effect reduced its aggregate debt service payments by over $500,000 over the next 13 years. Current Liabilities decreased primarily due to the timing of bank transfer s for the June 30 payroll s and reductions in accrued liabilit ies for both the faculty voluntary buyout and athletic contractual obligations . The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position presents the results of operations for the fiscal year. Revenues and expenses are recognized when earned or incurred, regardless of when cash is received. The statement indicates whether the financial condition has improved or deteriorated during the fiscal year. The statement presents the revenues received by the University , both operating and nonoperating, and the expenses paid by the University , operating and nonop erating, and any other revenues, expenses, gains, or losses received or spent by the University . Generally speaking, operating revenues are received for providing goods and services to the various customers and constituencies of the University . Operati ng expenses are those expenses paid to acquire or produce the goods and services provided in return for the operating revenues, and to carry out the mission of the University . Nonoperating revenues are revenues received for which goods and services are no t provided directly to the payor. Although the University of Memphis is dependent upon state appropriations and gifts to fund educational and general operations, under GASB standards these funding sources are reported as nonoperating revenues, as is inves tment income. As a result, the University has historically reported an excess of operating expenses over operating revenues, resulting in an financial results for the year. ended June 30, 2013, and June 30, 2012, follows . THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2013 6 Operating Revenues The following summarizes the operating revenues by source that were used to fund operating activities for the last two fiscal years: 59% 17% 14% 10% 2013 Tuition and Fees Grants and Contracts Sales and Services Auxiliaries 57% 19% 14% 10% 2012 THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2013 7 Comparison of FY 2013 to FY 20 1 2 Tuition revenues increased by $7.6 million primarily due to an 8.2% increase in student fees.

The University has chosen to report the expenses in their natural classification on the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and has displayed the functional classification in the notes to the financial statements. Th e following summarizes the operating expenses by natural classifications for the last two fiscal years: Comparison of FY 2013 to FY 2012 Salar ies and wages increased primarily due to a 2.5% across the board pay raise effective July 1, 2012. Benefits expense increased and s cholarships expense decreased by $1 3. 5 million due to the reclassification of tuition remissions for graduate assistants from scholarships to benefits. Deprecia tion expense decreased by $10 million due to the removal of periodicals as a capitalized asset in FY 2012 which resulted in a corresponding increase in depreciation expense of $10.9 million that year. 45% 17% 23% 10% 5% 2013 Salaries and wages Benefits Utilities, Supplies, and Other Services Scholarships and Fellowships Depreciation 43% 13% 24% 13% 7% 2012 THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2013 8 Nonoperating Revenues and Expenses Certain revenue sources that the University relies on to provide funding for operations, including s tate noncapital appropriations, certain gifts and grants, and investment income are defined by the GASB as nonoperating.

These amounts were as follows for the last two fiscal years: Comparison of FY 2013 to FY 2012 Capital appropriations increased due to State Capital Maintenance Projects fund ing for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning ( HVAC ) , underground utility upgrades and elevator modernization. While the Defense Audit b uilding on the Park Avenue Campus valued at $9 million was transferred to the University by the United States government in FY 2013 , c apital gifts decreased by $2 0 million due to the acquisition of the Lambuth Campus that was capitalized in FY 2012.

Economic Factors That Will Affect the Future Despite relatively modest economic growth, the state has been able to make up additional ground previously lost over the course of the r ecession . The July 2013 collections of th e Tennessee Department of Revenue revealed a 4.4% increase from July 2012 collections. Even though t continue on a gradual upward trend in the midst of a still - uncertain econom ic recovery in Tennessee, the impact this will have on future higher education funding both in operating appropriation and future building projects is not clear. For the sixth consecutive year, base State appropriations will be reduced. The imp act of the reduction for FY 2014 is $737,300 or 0.9 % from the previous year. Since FY 2008, the University has sustained a cumulative State appropriati on reduction of $44.3 million or 36% by FY 2014 . However, the Governor reiterated in his 2013 St ate of the State address his commitment to making significant progress in education. He revealed his THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2013 12 r 2025. The expectation is that higher education will be a prime area of focus during the upcoming legislative session, with an emphasis on the financial burden of higher education on students. To compensate for the reduction in State appropriations, the University will utilize FY 2013 operating carry forward funds to transition to reduced State appropriations in accordance f inancial plan, which includes b udget reductions, restructuring and position attritions . T he U niversity has imp lemented a 6.0 % incr ease in student fees for FY 2014 which will provide funding for faculty merit and equity, tenure track faculty promotions, student retention efforts and scholarships costs associated with tuition increases. We continue to remain cogniza nt of the impact future tuition increases may have on our students and are striving to minimize tuition increases to the greatest extent possibl e. In July 2013, Interim President R. Brad Martin began his leadership role at the University of Memphis. He has outlined several key initiatives which include a strategic review of the iciency , in addition to a commitment to build actionable plans to increase enrollment by 1,000 students for 2014 - 15 and 1,000 for 2015 - 16. line courses and the expansion of course offerings at the U niversity of Memphis Lambuth Campus provide a significant opportunity for enrollment and revenue growth. We are not aware of any other factors, decisions, or conditions that are expected to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operation during this fiscal year.

The financial statements present only that portion of the attributable to the transactions of t he University of Memphis . The University of Memphis Foundation is considered a component unit of the University . Although the University does not control the timing or amo unt of receipts from the F oundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, that the F oundation holds and invests are restricted to the activities of the University by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the F oundation can only b e used by, or for the benefit of, the University , the F oundation is considered a component unit of the University and is discretely presented in the financial statements. See Note 2 2 for more detailed information about the component unit and how to obtain the report. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The University and F financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to governmental colleges and universities engaged in business - type activities as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). BASIS OF ACCOUNTING For financial statement purposes, the University is considered a special - purpose government engaged only in busine ss - type activities. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability i s incurred, re gardless of the timing of related cash flows. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met. All significant interfund transactions have been eliminated. The University h as classified its revenues and expenses as either operating or nonoperating according to the following criteria: Operating revenues and expenses are those that have the characteristics of exchange transactions. Operating revenues include 1) tuition and f ees, net of scholarship discounts and allowances, 2) most federal, state, local and private grants and contracts, 3) sales and services of auxiliary enterprises, net of scholarship discounts and allowances, and 4) interest on institutional loans. Oper ating expenses include 1) salaries and wages, 2) employee benefits, 3) scholarships and fellowships, 4) depreciation, and 5) utilities, supplies, and other services. Nonoperating revenues and expenses include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange transactions, such as gifts and contributions, and other activities that are defined as nonoperating by GASB Statement 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary and Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Governmental Entities that Use Proprietary Fund Acc ounting , and GASB Statement 34, such as state appropriations and investment income. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, policy to determine whether to use restricted or unrestricted resources fir st depending upon existing facts and circumstances . THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 13 20 CASH EQUIVALENTS This classification includes instruments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less. INVENTORIES Inventories are val ued at the lower of cost or market. All other items are maintained on an average cost or first - in, first - out basis.

THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 13 33 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used as of June 30, 2013 . Money Market funds: Valued at cost, which approx imates fair value. Limited Partnerships and LLCs: Limited partnerships and LLC investmen ts are generally valued at the F which are valued daily ba sed upon quoted prices in active markets. Certain investees maintain underlying holdings of non - marketable securities whose fair values are estimated by management of the investee. aster - feed The F oundation values these investments at estimated fair value based upon its equity in the estimated fair value of the investee. These investees are valued at estimated fair value as determined by their management wh ich is based upon the net asset valuations of the underlying investment entities. Fair values for the securities of the underlying investment entities are often not readily available and accordingly, the fair values are estimated by management of those en tities. Common/collective trust funds: Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of units held by the F oundation at year - end. Mutual Funds: Valued at quoted market price s which are based upon the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the F oundation at year - end. U.S. government securities and corporate bonds: Valued at quoted market prices or valuations provided by commercial pricing services or the mean of the bid and ask prices provided by investment brokers. The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although management believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of differ ent methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Cash Cash c onsists of demand deposit accounts. The bank balances at June 30, 2013 , w ere insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. Investments Investments are reco rded on the date of acquisition and are stated at market value. Unrealized gains and losses are determined by the difference between market values at the beginning and end of the year. Investment securities held at year - end were as follows: Alternative Investments - The F oundation has certain limited partnership/LLC investments that are classified for fair value measurement purposes as Level 3 . The estimated fair value of these assets is $ 3 4 ,394,180 at June 30, 2013 . THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 13 34 The Foundation be lieves that the carrying amount of such alternative investments is a reasonable estimate of fair value as of June 30, 2013 . Because these investments are not readily marketable, the estimated value is subject to uncertainty and, therefore, may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and such differences could be material. These investments are made in accordance s asset classes in order to achieve an appropriate level of diversification. These investments are designed to enhance diversification and provide reductions in overall portfolio volatility. The fair values are estimated by the gers using various valuation techniques and are subject to audit by the Pledges Receivable - Pledges receivable are summarized below net of the allowance for doubtful accounts: Endowments T he University of Memphis wment consists of approximately 4 5 0 individual funds established for a va riety of purposes. Its endowment includes both donor - restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by GAAP, Net Position associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor - imposed restrictions. Interpretation of Relevant Law The Board of Trustees of the University of Memphis Foundation has interpreted the Uni form Prudent Ma nagement of Institutional Funds Act (the Act) as adopted by Tennessee as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor - restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary . As a result of this interpretation, the Foundation classifies as permanently restricted Net Position (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, (c) a ny donor specified accumulations to the permanent endowment funds made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument. The remaining portion of the donor - restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted Net Position is classified as temporarily restricted Net Position until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the F oundation in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by the Act. In accordance with the Act, the F oundation considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor - restricted endowment funds: 1. The duration and preservation of the fund 2. The purposes of the F oundation and the endowment fund 3. General economic conditions 4. The possi ble effect of inflation or deflation 5. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 6. Other resources of the F oundation 7. The investment policies of the F oundation THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 13 35 F unds with Deficiencies From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individual donor restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the F oundation is required to retain in a fund of perpetual duration. In accordance with U.S. ge nerally accepted accounting principles , deficiencies of this nature are reported in unrestricted Net Position . These deficiencies resulted from unfavorable market fluctuations that occurred after the investment of permanently restricted contributions and/ or continued appropriation for fees and expenditures. At June 30, 2013 , deficiencies of this nature totaled $ 1,045,291 . Return Objectives and Risk Parameters The F oundation has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt t o provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor - restricted funds that the organization must hold in per petuity or for a donor - specified period(s) as well as board - designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce consistent long - term growth of capital without undue THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 13 36 market cycle of at least 6 % over the inflation rate. A market cycle shall generally be considered to be a three to five year period. Actual re turns may vary from the total return objective. Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives To satisfy its long - term rate - of - return objectives, the Foundation relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capita l appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The Foundation targets a diversified asset allocation that places a significant emphasis on equity - based investments to achieve its long - term return objectives within pru dent risk restraints. Spending Policy and How the Investment Objectives Relate The Foundation has a policy of budgeting (appropriating) for expenditure each year a percentage of its ugh the fiscal year - end one year prece d ing the fiscal year in which the expenditure is planned. For fiscal year 2013 this percentage was four point seven five percent (4.75%). In establishing this policy, the Foundation considered the long - term expected r eturn on its endowment funds. Accordingly, over the long - term, the Foundation expects the to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets h eld in perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts and investment return.
