The B.S. degree program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (CAC/ABET). The program educational objectives for the Bachelor's degree in computer science are that within a few years after graduation, graduates are expected to: Demonstrate an ability to solve complex problems through the use of computer science as evidenced by successful entrance into and advancement in the computer science profession. Demonstrate an appreciation for lifelong learning, and for the value of continuing professional development by pursuing graduate education, professional education, or continuing education opportunities, attainment of professional licensure, and/or membership in professional societies. Graduates with a B.S. in computer science will have acquired the following: a. An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline; b. An ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution; c. An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs; d. An ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal; e. An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities; f. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; g. An ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society; h. Recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional development; i. An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice; j. An ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices; k. An ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity. A. University General Education Program (41 hours) See Graduation from the University for the University General Education Program requirements. Note the following requirements specified for the Computer Science major: Mathematics - MATH 1910; Natural Science - PHYS 2110/2111, 2120/2121 or CHEM 1110/1111, 1120/1121, or BIOL 1110/1111, BIOL 1120/1121; ECON 2020 is strongly recommended for the Social Science requirement. B. College and Degree (B.S.) Requirements (12 hours) The College and Bachelor of Science requirements are in addition to the University General Education Program requirements. C. The Major (63 hours in addition to University General Education Program and B.S. degree requirements) Completion of MATH 1910, 1920, 3242, 4614; three Natural Science courses and labs (one sequence as mentioned above in part A and a third course from part A); COMP 1900 (4), 1950, 2150 (4), 2700(4), 3115, 3410(4), 3825, 4030, 4040, 4081, 4270, 4601, 4882 and two COMP electives, which may not be any of 4001, 4005, or 4014. Seniors are required to take the Computer Science Field Test the same semester that they take COMP 4882. D. Electives Electives may be chosen to bring the total number of semester hours to 120. COMP 4001, 4005, and 4014 may not be used to fulfill the elective requirement. E.

Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program in Computer Science This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Science in Computer Science during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.S./M.S. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Computer Science. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.S. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.S. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Computer Science department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in computer science. Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.S./M.S. program, which allows them to take graduate courses in computer science. To continue in the program past the B.S., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the Computer Science department's M.S. program. Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply to undergraduate GPA.
