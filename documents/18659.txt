New Student Orientation Every year, the Recruitment and Orientation Office determines a schedule for New Student Orientation sessions to be held in the summer . The exact dates are not set until spring, but over the past s everal years, there have been 12 or 13 two - day sessions with the advis ing time being on the first day around 11:30 . The schedule generally i nclude s two or three Transfer/Adult sessions that provide a time for advising . These events run from late May to the end of July or first week of August. All departments in our college are asked to participate as needed for New Student Orientation to ensure that new advisees receive contact wit h an advisor in their major from the beginning of their UM academic experience. The advising time can include a general explanation of the program , so that all majors in an area know the requirements , followed by a one - on - one sc hedule planning session. Students must leave the advising session with an Advising and Planning Registration Worksheet filled out with a list of course prefixes and numbers so that they know exactly what courses they should take. Advisors are encouraged t o list a couple of alternate courses in case any of the courses chosen are full. For best course selection, advisors are encouraged to assist students with registering for classes during the advising session. NSO Information for Advisors Students compl ete several questions while registering for orientation that will be included on the New Student Profile provided for advisors prior to NSO. s New Student Orientation website: 2010 - 2013 New Student Orientation Attendance Major 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Anthropology 7 6 1 6 4 Biology 73 25* *0 *1 *0 Chemistry 32 32 *5 *1 *26 Computer Science 27 8* *4 9 *12 Criminal Justice 33 40 42 28 41 Economics 1 1 1 0 1 English 1 7 19 24 17 7 Foreign Language 1 4 12 15 11 4 Earth Sciences 1 3 1 3 2 History 14 12 11 10 8 International Studies 4 4 1 6 7 Mat hematics 11 11 7 7 2 Philosophy 1 3 0 3 0 Physics 4 6 6 2 3 Political Science 18 9 11 17 15 Pre - professional 24 2* *0 *0 *0 Psychology 46 54 58 62 45 Social Work 1 2 5 3 6 Sociology 6 4 3 9 4 Total 334 249 195 195 187 *ACC advised majors m eeting certain criteria.
