Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree BBA BBA ACCT comes/BBADegreeAccountancyLearningOutcome s.pdf Course Methodology This course has deadlines that have to be met, but students will be given a range of dates for completing all assignments and exams. Some of the work will require you to work outside on cl ass. The College of Business has labs available in rooms 100 and 372 that you can use. In addition, the Tech Lab in the Student Center is available. You do not have to have Excel 2013 on your computer when you are doing the lessons because the lessons a re in a simulation on SIMnet. However, there are 4 projects that will require that you have Excel 2013 on the computer you are using. You will need to either work where you have this software installed or if you do not have the software, you can download a free copy at: The most important expectation is that students stay engaged and complete assignments in a timely manner. The course is designed to help the student complete the work without undue pressure, but the timeline requires the student to be working both in class and out of class on a regular basis. All assignments have definite due dates. There will be no make - up exams, so it is expected that stude nts plan to be in class on the day of an exam. As with all technology, there may be times when there are computer problems. Any computers problems can be addressed by one of the options shown on the eCourseware Content Tab. Students must address any home computer technology problems quickly so that not much time lost is lost. A good suggestion is to have a backup computer plan. Grading and Evaluation Criteria Students will be evaluated in the following areas: 1. Exams 60% of grade There will be 5 exams during the semester. Each exam is worth 100 points. Each exam is 12% of your grade. Two of the exams (2 nd and 5 th ) will cover material from the Information Systems Today textbook. These exams will be online in eCourseware. Exams 1 and 3 will be on Excel applications and will be online in SIMnet. Exam 4 is a Microsoft® Office Specialist Certification Exam for Excel 2013. The exam must be given at The University of Memphis campus or at another certified testing center. Other certified agencies include the Lambuth campus and New Horizons. If the student passes the exam at the required level, the student can earn a Microsoft Certification. Certification is not required for pas sing the course; however, each student is given the opportunity to earn that certification. This exam grade will count 12% of the class grade as do each of the other exams. Students may take the Certification exam twice. The higher grade will be the exam grade for the class. 2. Projects in SIMnet 20% of grade Students will have 4 projects in SIMnet to submit for grading. Each project will be graded separately and then the average of the 4 will be the overall score for 20% of you final grad e. This is the only part of the Excel work where you must have Excel 2013 on the computer. You can choose to download a free version, work in the campus labs or at a library or any other place where you have 2013. 3. Computers Now 5% of grade Students will have tutorial lessons on SIMnet concerning the computer hardware/software. Tutorial lessons are evaluated on SIMnet. 4. PowerPoint Presentation 10% of grade Each student will create a PowerPoint presentation as assigned by the professor. 5. Business and Information Enrichment Points 5% of grade Students will be given several opportunities to earn BIT points which will enhance your overall grade.

There is additional information about these points at the end of this syllabus and also on a separate page of the Content section for your class on eCourseware. Specific due dates will be stated for the above activities. Failure to complete items before the due date will result no credit. It can be assumed that if no due date is specified, the work is due by the end of the week in which the assignment is made, so that you are alway s up - to - date. An optional comprehensive final covering the Information Systems Today text materials and Excel applications can be substituted for a low grade on any one of the five 100 - point exams. No one has to take the comprehensive final it serves onl y to improve the grade or to make up for a test that was not taken.
