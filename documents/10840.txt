Blog Dashboard Update Complete I wanted to report that the updates to the Dashboard have now gone through. Please notice the visual differences in the top and left side bars, as well as on your blog dashboard.  This update came from Edublogs due to a new update of WordPress.  WordPress is the system blogs.memphis.edu runs on. All tools remain in the same layout and location with the update, but the environment has a more modern and user friendly look. The biggest improvement is that the dashboard is completely mobile, touch, and tablet friendly, meaning it is much easier to write a new post or manage a site from any web browser on any device – no special app needed! Edublogs is also in the process of updating the screenshots on the Edublogs support site . If you have any questions, please contact the umTech Helpdesk at 901.678.8888 or email umblogs@memphis.edu .
