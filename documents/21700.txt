Employee Safety &amp; Health Our goal is to make the university a safe place for all the segments of the community. We do this by conducting regular fire and safety inspections of all buildings and fire protection equipment. We investigate all fires, complaints about safety, and accidents involving injury to an employee on campus. We also conduct training classes and provide safety information to employees and students.
