University College About Undergraduate Graduate Resources Online Home University College Discover the uniqueness of a University College degree. Welcome to University College. Our mission is to provide interdisciplinary educational opportunities in a flexible, relevant, and responsive format. Since its creation in 1975, the college has been an entry point for students, an innovator of new programs, a catalyst for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary efforts throughout the campus, and a facilitator for the community to interact with the University. We seek to provide access to quality educational programs and services for a diverse community of traditional and non-traditional adult learners who seek change through increased knowledge and skill. University College offers individualized and interdisciplinary degrees not traditionally offered by other colleges on the University of Memphis campus. Courses can be completed on campus, online, or a combination of both in order to meet the flexible needs of your schedule. Areas of study include 21 concentrations among our Bachelor of Professional Studies and Bachelor of Liberal Studies degrees. Our Master of Arts in Liberal Studies degree allows students the option of developing personalized areas of emphasis, and our online Master of Professional Studies program offers areas of study in strategic leadership, human resources leadership, or training and development. Degrees can also be customized to fit specific learning interests, and credit hours may be earned through work experience and professional training.
