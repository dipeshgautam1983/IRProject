The total includes gifts of cash, pledges and planned gifts to the University of Memphis Foundation, and gifts-in-kind and private grants to the U of M and University of Memphis Research Foundation. The new record represents a groundswell of support from many more donors, 10,359 in all, compared to 9,557 in the previous year. The number of alumni who supported the U of M grew by more than 14 percent. Private fundraising improves our ability to both serve students and support programs critical to the U of M. Every single gift makes a difference in the life of our university.  This effort is not only a great way to end the academic year, but provides momentum heading into the upcoming academic year.
