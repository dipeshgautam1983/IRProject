About Professor Erlenbusch Verena Erlenbusch (DPhil, University of Sussex) joined the department in 2013. Before coming to Memphis, she taught at St. Mary's University and the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, TX. In spring and summer 2011, she was a Visiting Scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. Verena's main research lies at the intersection of political philosophy, the philosophy of law, and continental philosophy. Specifically, she brings to bear Foucault's genealogical method on the phenomenon of terrorism. As a consequence, her research interests extend to the methodological import of Foucault's work for political philosophy, the significance of race in current conceptions of terrorism, and sovereignty, power, and violence in modern and contemporary continental philosophy. Verena's work is also concerned with questions of diversity and inclusive pedagogy in philosophy. During the 2015/16 academic year, Verena will be teaching Values in the Modern World, Philosophy of Law, and a graduate seminar (with Professor Mary Beth Mader) on gender and sexuality. In the past, she has taught courses on the history of sovereignty, Foucault and race, Critical Race Theory, and Kafka and German-Jewish Philosophy. Verena also serves as Director of Placement and as the pre-law Faculty Affiliate Advisor for the Philosophy Department. When she is not doing Philosophy, she can be found at the gym, where she is honing her kickboxing skills.
