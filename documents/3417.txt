Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.B.A./M.A. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Economics. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.B.A. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.A. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Economics department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in economics.

To continue in the program past the B.B.A., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the Economics department's M.A. program.
