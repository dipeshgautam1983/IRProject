The Department of Public and Nonprofit Administration is a unit within the School of Urban Affairs and Public Policy. Its Master of Public Administration degree program educates students for careers in public service and for employment with government, private, nonprofit, and publicly-oriented organizations. The program combines interdisciplinary academic preparation with governmental and nonprofit field experience. The program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration. Program objectives are: (1) development of generalist public service management and leadership knowledge, skills and competencies including an emphasis on public values and ethical actions and consequences; (2) ability to apply public management and leadership knowledge and skills; and (3) ability to integrate public administration concepts, theories, and applications. All graduate students must comply with the general requirements of the Graduate School (see Admissions Regulations , Academic Regulations , and Minimum Degree Requirements ) as well as the program requirements of the degree being pursued. PPI STATEMENT All college transcripts and test score information should be sent directly to Graduate Admissions. Beginning with Summer and Fall 2013 admittance , the Master of Arts program in Public and Non-Profit Administration highly recommends the ETS® Personal Potential Index (PPI) Evaluation Report containing a minimum of three (3) evaluations from separate evaluators in order to consider your application complete. The PPI is a third-party evaluative tool administered by the ETS (Educational Testing Service) organization. There is no fee to submit the PPI report to the University of Memphis. You can create an ETS PPI account and review the ETS PPI Information Bulletin, which explains the service, at . PPI - Steps At A Glance Create an ETS PPI account to begin the process. Provide contact information for the evaluators you would like to complete an ETS PPI evaluation. ETS sends an email to each evaluator inviting them to access the ETS PPI system and complete your evaluation. Each evaluator logs in to the ETS PPI system to rate you on six personal attributes and provide an overall evaluation. Evaluators also may provide optional comments for each attribute as well as for the overall rating. You are notified via e-mail when each time that one of your evaluators completes their PPI. **THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP** After all of your evaluators have completed their PPI reports, you must log back into your PPI account, designate the University of Memphis Office of Graduate Admissions to receive an ETS PPI Evaluation Report and select the evaluations that are to be included in the report. Our office cannot access your PPI recommendations until you complete this step. Once you designate the University of Memphis to receive an ETS PPI Evaluation Report, ETS creates an evaluation report and sends it electronically to the University of Memphis, Office of Graduate Admissions. Allow up to 5 days for the report to be processed and sent to the University of Memphis. View a sample PPI Report. The evaluators/faculty members who you choose should be individuals that you believe are best able to objectively comment on your intellectual and professional achievements and potential. We may call or write your recommenders for more information. II. Master of Public Administration (MPA) Degree Program has concentrations in nonprofit administration and public policy/management. A.
