Courses to Consider About For Advisors For Students Contact Us Feedback Home Courses to Consider For Students For Students Star Rating...what does it mean? In a manner similar to the way that Netflix somehow knows what movies you might like, Courses to Consider may help you make a choice between two equal course options. Let's say you want to take a course to complete your General Education Humanities requirement this semester. You don't know the difference between PHIL 1101 and ART 1030, and perhaps neither is of interest to you. Courses to Consider uses a LOT of information, including how students like you have done in these courses, to make a recommendation. Recommendations don't indicate how much you will LIKE a course, but rather your possibility of academic SUCCESS. What we found out after the Fall 2012 semester is that if you take a course which is recommended with 4 or 5 stars, you are likely to be successful in the course. No guarantees, of course, because success depends on your effort. So what does "predictive analytics" mean for you? Look for the 4 or 5 star ratings to make decisions between two equal choices!
