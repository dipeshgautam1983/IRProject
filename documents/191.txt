p. 1 Course Syllabus ECON 7811/8811 : E conometrics II Fall 2015 3.0 credit hours (Last updated: 8/ 19 /2015) Instructor: Dr. Andrew Hussey Phone : 678 - 1487 E - mail: ajhussey@memphis.edu Office: 423 Fogelman College Admin Building Office Hours: Tu 1:30 - 2:30, Th 4:05 - 5 & by appointment TA: D emba Fofana ( d fofana @memphis.edu ) Course Overview This is an empirical class with concentratio n in a pplied m icroeconometrics . ( W e will not cover any Time Series topics , which are reserved for ECON 8812 . ) Its goal is to give you knowledge ( in various econometrics methods and theory ) and the tool s ( in particular, Stata) to solve real - life problems . Focus will be on techniques used within the economics discipline, but these approaches will also apply to other soc ial science s and business fields. Topics will include : panel data; instrumental variables and simultaneous equations models; estimation of treatment effects; binomial and multinomial choice models; censored data and sample selectivity; regression discontinuity design; quantile regressio n . Pre - Requisite : ECON 7 81 0 / 8810 or similar background with permission of instructor . Recommended Text: Besides the class notes ( posted online ) , t he recommended textbook s are Mostly Harmless Econometrics by Angrist and Pischke , and Microeconometrics Using Stata, by Cameron & Tri vedi (applied micro problems solved in Stata step - by - step with detailed explanations) . In addition , I find the following text book s very useful for anyone doing empirical econometrics: Stock and Watson, Introduction to Econometrics (simple explanations, adv anced undergraduate level ); Berndt, The Practice of Econometrics: Classic and Contemporary (many real - life case studies); Wooldridge , Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data (the best book on panel data analysis) ; Long and Freese, Regression Models for Categorical Dependent V a riables Using Stata (very thorough and approachable for the topics described by the title) . Location of Course Materials : All homework assignments (and other course documents) will be found on the eCourseware website once they are assigned. Course Objectives : By successfully completing this course, students will be able to : 1. Understand the theoretical underpinnings of several empirical microeconomic techniques 2. Distinguish between alternative techniq ues in terms of their pros and cons and appropriateness of use. 3. Critically r ead peer reviewed articles that use a variety of econometric approaches. 4. Proficiently use Stata for data manipulation and analysis.

They will consist of several parts . Often, you will have to carefully read an assigned paper and then replicate its results in Stata. The homeworks will be graded on - , which roughly correspond to 60/80/100 points. very difficult to complete a homework assignment in one day, so I strongly recommend starting early. You may (and are encouraged to) work on these assignments in groups, but each student must write an d turn in their own assignments. Class Participation As this is an advanced grad uate class, its format would be the While formal attendance will not be taken, I expect all students to take active part in the in - class discussion. T students or pairs of students will be assigned to give brief presentations of journal articles in order to initiate classroom discussion (4 % of grade) . Presentation assignments will be made in part based on student preferen ces and academic discipline. Final Course Grades Final course grades are earned a ccording to the following table.
