"CEPH Accreditation represents a huge step forward for our School of Public Health, recognizing a uniquely talented faculty and positioning them to both grow and have broad impact on our community. The school should quickly become a national leader," said UofM President M. David Rudd. The SPH offers master's programs in public health and health administration and PhD programs in epidemiology, social and behavioral sciences, and health systems and policy. "As former dean of the Graduate School at the University of Memphis, I was privileged to participate in the launch of the School of Public Health," said UofM Provost Karen Weddle-West. "I have witnessed the phenomenal growth in scholarship, national ranking of programs and translational research generated by the stellar faculty and student-scholars. In a relatively short period of time, the School of Public Health has significantly impacted health disparities and health policy in the community and nationally. "Accreditation by CEPH validates the high-quality programs that comprise the School of Public Health and contributes to our distinction as the only TBR university classified by the prestigious Carnegie Foundation as a (RU/HA) Research University with high levels of activity. I commend the dean, faculty and staff for their hard work." The School's mission is to improve population health, promote health equity, and produce the next generation of public health leaders through innovation and excellence in interdisciplinary education, research, service and community engagement.
