Such poverty tends to persist over the life cycle and across generations. One intuitively plausible explanation is that the poor simply have insufficient income left for substantive savings or investment after paying for necessities. However, empirical wo rk on the consumption patterns of poor individuals by Collins et al. (2009) and Banerjee and Duflo (2007) suggests otherwise. Instead, evidence suggests that r elatively few poor people save or invest their income as if they were long - run welfare maximizing . Economists and other social scientists have offered varying theorie s as to why this is the case, all of which imply different prescriptive soluti ons to reduce poverty. Some researchers have speculated that the source of persistent poverty is the time - pre ferences of the poor , as evidence suggests that the poor tend to exhibit behavior consistent with hyperbolic discounting (Aleem 1990; Laibson 1998; Skiba and Tobacman 2007) . An alternate line of inquiry proposes that the apparent irrationality of poor peop le is an artifact of a mis - specified utility function. Banerjee and Mullainathan (2010) distinguish between normal no utility when consumed by a future self. T he availability of temptation goods means that temptation spending Given their relatively lower wealth and income, the poor are impacted by these goods differently than the non - poor. In particular, assuming that the strength of temptation is declining in income, the poor will tend to spend a larger portion of their income on temptation goods. Thus, although they are optimizing with respect to the available alternatives, t heir choices are inconsistent with savings and investment that will allow them to escape a poverty trap. Thus, 3 Mullainathan and Banerjee argue that unless and until poor individuals acquire a certain critical level of wealth, they will not adopt savings be havior consistent with long - run optimization. 1 Another explanation that has received less attention is that insufficient savings may result from aspirational consumption and social comparison . This idea goes back to Veblen (1899) who suggested that above a certain subsistence income, humans choose a consumption plan to signal component of behavior, this may . Specifically, if lower income individuals a re - up - with - the - higher income individuals even though such behavior would not be long - run maximizing over purchasing capacity (Frank 1999 ; see also Komlos and Salamon 2008 ). For example, Moav and Neeman (20 12 ) show that when both human capital and conspicuous consumption can serve as signals of unobserved income, then status - seeking individuals will have convex savings functions. An alternative line of argument contends that envy or observation could actually increase efforts towards human capital enhanc ement , thereby reducing poverty over time (Corneo and Jeanne 1997, 2001a, 2001b). To resolve these issues, Van de Ven et al. (2009) distinguish between benign and malicious envy. T - up leads to a pulling - Thus after observing the status of other wealthier/richer individuals the poor might be motivated by one of these forms of envy. In the case of the latter, if the distance between relative states is deemed to o great and pulling down is not possible, the person simply quits all together. This is related to the question of whether comp etition encourages or discourages effort (e.g. Brown 2011). In the end, we believe the question of which motive dominates is an empirical one. Thus, to explore these hypot hese s we design a laboratory experiment in which we induce wealth and income differen ces between subjects to compare their behavior in a simple, two - period life - cyc le savings and consumption task. Participants decide in period 1 whether to invest a portion of their income in a lottery that may yield a larger income in period 2 ; the remaind er is consumed . In period 2, participants who entered the lottery learn their new income, and then all 1 Karelis (2007) reaches a similar conclusion arguing that below some level of wealth, marginal utility is increasing ereby leading to insufficient savings. 4 participants consume their entire income automatically. We vary 1) the source of inequality (initial wealth or initial income) and 2) whether individuals have information about wealth and income differences , and we measure investment rates across treatments . Our design employs a technique intended to control for participant risk preferences, so that any expected utility maximize r should optimally choose to invest. After the experiment, we also elicit non - incentivized choices that can be used to provide bounds on individual risk - and time - preference parameters. W e find evidence that when information is available about others incomes , i.e. when social comparison is possible , there are differences in behavior between individuals of different initial incomes, but not in those of different initial wealth . Spec ifically, we find that low - income individuals are substantially less likely to invest than high - income individuals. However, in the absence of information about (where envy is impossible), we observe no differences in behavior between types . Thus, our data suggest that malicious envy over income , which manifests itself in a is an important source of suboptimal savings choices. Policy makers could potentially find these insights helpful. If social comparison leads to a discouragement effect for persons that are income - poor it might be better policy to offe r more individualized instruction in life - skills lessons where participants are not aware of the outcomes or incomes of others. In a broader context, the use of non - organic mixed - income housing is a perfect example, where residents know their own income bu t not those of their neighbors might lead to more stable communities. 1. Experimental Design Our e xperiment is designed to measure the impact of 1) income and wealth differences circumstances on individual behavior in an investment task. The investment task is extremely simple to facilitate inference. Participants are assigned an initial wealth in dollars and an initial income Period 1 and period 2 incomes are combined at the end of the experiment to determine 1 income (meaning that this income is automatically banked towards the chance of winning the ion of period 1 income in a lottery that may yield a higher period 2 5 income , which can then be combined with the remaining period 1 income and all used towards the chance of winning the $10 prize. Investment in the lotter y costs 1 point, and it allows part icipants to observe a coin flip which increases their income in the next period by 3 points if the coin reads heads and keeps income the same if the coin reads tails . In the first period, participants observe their wealth and income and privately then choo se If they invest, their income is reduced by 1 point and the remaining points are consumed , i.e. banked towards the chance of winning the $10 prize . Then they observe the outcome of the coin flip. If they do not invest, their e ntire income is consumed , i.e. banked towards winning the $10 prize. In the second period, all remaining income is automatically consumed , or in other words banked , and the sum of points consumed across both periods determines the probability that the part icipant wins the $10 prize. Each point consumed increases the probability of winning the prize by 0.1. Under this setup, we can normalize the utility of winning the prize to 1 and of not winning the prize to 0. Regardless of individual risk preferences ove r money payoffs , it is easy to show that utility is linearly increasing in the probability of winning the prize so that the utility maximizing choice for any agent that satisfies EU is independent of risk preferences (Berg et al. 1986). In particular, for any initial income less than 5 points, individuals should always choose In our experiment, there are two player types , variable manipulates how these types are defined. In the Income treatment, Rich and Poor types differ only in their initial income. Rich types have a period 1 income of 3 points, and Poor types have a period 1 income of 1 point. Both types begin with initial wealth of $7. In the Wealth treatment, Rich and Poor types d iffer only in their initial wealth. Rich types have an initial wealth of $21, and Poor types have an initial wealth of $7. 2 Both types have period 1 incomes of ex pected probability of winning the prize. Table 1 summarizes these treatment differences. 2 We chose income and wealth so that the ratio of Rich to Poor is 3:1, similar to that observed in the US using 60 years of average quintile data gathered from the Census Bureau which showed the income quintile 1 aver age income to be approximately one - third that of the middle quintile average income. 6 Table 1. Summary of Experiment Parameters . The table describes the parameters of the experiment for each player type in each treatment and also decomposes how indivi dual decisions and random draws impact expected payoffs from the experiment. The important point to emphasize is that the decision to Invest always leads to the same expected payoff increase , regardless of treatment and type. Income Treatment Wealth Treat ment Rich Poor Rich Poor Starting Wealth $7 $7 $21 $7 Pd. 1 Income 3 P ts 1 Pt 1 Pt 1 Pt Investment Cost 1 Pt 1 Pt 1 Pt 1 Pt Pd. 2 Income |Invest Heads Tails Heads Tails Heads Tails Heads Tails 6 Pts 3 Pts 4 Pts 1 Pt 4 Pts 1 Pt 4 Pts 1 Pt Pd 2 Income| 3 Pts 1 Pt 1 Pt 1 Pt Prob(Prize)|Invest Heads Tails Heads Tails Heads Tails Heads Tails 0.8 0.5 0.4 0.1 0.4 0.1 0.4 0.1 0.6 0.2 0.2 0.2 Expected Earnings|Invest $13.5 $9.5 $23.5 $9.5 $13 $9 $23 $9 For example, a rich person in the income treatment knows for certain that she will leave the experiment with at least $7 since this is her starting wealth. She also knows that she has 3 points in of her 3 points that she has in period 1. If she decides to invest , a coin flip will determine her period 2 income. If the coin reads heads, she has a period 2 income of 6 points (the 3 she was going to ge t in period 2 anyway and an addition al 3 from a successful coin flip). If the coin reads tails, she has 3 points in period 2 , Pd. 2 Income|Invest If she decides not to inv est in the lottery, her period 2 income is the 3 points she was Thus the probability of winning the prize from investing is either 0.8 (her period 1 income of 3 points minus the 1 point she gave up to invest in the lottery plus the 6 points from 7 period 2 from a successful coin flip) or 0.5 (her period 1 income of 3 points minus the 1 point she gave up to invest in the lottery plus the 3 points from period 2 from an unsuc cessful coin Prob(Prize)|Invest If she does not invest at all her probability of winning the prize is 0.6 (her period 1 income of 3 points plus her period 2 income of 3 points Invest The expected probability of winning the lottery is higher if she chooses invest (0.65 > 0.6). Thus, the utility maximizing strategy is to invest, and the same is true for a poor type. Our second treatment variable manipulates the information part icipants have about the decisions made by others. Specifically, we first collected data on the behavior of participants in Income and Wealth treatments when all decisions, incomes, and wealths were private information. Then, a week later, we conducted new sessions of two additional treatment s , which we call the Income - Observe and Wealth - Observe treatments, and in which, prior to making their decisions, participants were told the following: CASE 1: INCOME In this experiment, one - half of the people have a low income of 1 point, and one - half of people have a high income of 3 points. Last week, another group of students made the same choices that you will make now. Over 80% of people with low income chose Invest, and over 70% of people with high income chose Inv est. Of those who chose Invest, 23% of people with low income and 64% of people with high income received the additional payment of $10. CASE 2: WEALTH In this experiment, one - half of the people have a low wealth of $7, and one - half of people have a high wealth of $21. Last week, another group of students made the same choices that you will make now. Over 70% of people with low wealth chose Invest, and over 80% of people with high wealth chose Invest. Of those who chose Invest, 35% of people with low wealt h and 23% of people with high wealth received the additional payment of $10. The figures presented in those statements are drawn directly from the data from the Income and Wealth treatments. Thus, after observing how others who faced similar circumstances made their decisions, we again observe how income and wealth differences impact behavior. Note that the decision problem and the optimal solution are completely unaffected by the introduction of this information. Thus any differences in behavior are drive n by factors other than the strategic aspects of the choice environment. 8 However, note that this treatment variation, in addition to providing information about p ossible choices (the observed probabilities are very close to the theoretical probabilities, as expected). While subjects would have been able to deduce these conditional probabilities from the instructions, the examples may make them more salient. Thus, i t may be that any changes in behavior under the Observe treatment s are driven by this reinforcement rather than by mere the Observe treatment, which we call the Info treatment in which subjects learn only the or outcomes ). This generates two additional treatments : the Income - Info and Wealth - Info treatments, which allow us to assess the robustnes s of our results and disentangle the mechanism by which behavior is altered. In these treatments, we employ the first sentence of the announcement from the corresponding Observe treatment and omit all information about past choices. This combination of tre atment variables generates a 2x3 experimental design. We performed 1 large session of each treatment , and in total we collected data on 228 subjects . Each experimental session consisted of 3 5 - 4 5 participants, recruited from the student body of the Universi ty of Alabama. Participants entered a large classroom where they privately read self - paced instructions (a copy is available in Appendix A) . A monitor was available to answer any questions about the instructions. After all participants made their decisions (see Appendix B for a copy of the decision sheet) , they also completed a short questionnaire designed to collect data about financial responsibility, risk preferences and time preferences (see Appendix C). We employed a hypothetical multiple price list me chanism to elicit risk and time preferences (see e.g. Holt and Laury 2002). After making their decisions, p articipants were called indivi dually to results. Then , their total consumption was tallied, the experimenter rolled a 10 - sided die to determine whether they received the additional $10 prize, and they were paid their earnings . Earnings were the sum of initial wealth, which was guaranteed, and the additional prize of $10 if the 10 - sided die roll was successful. participation payment. All participants received their earnings in cash privately. After they were paid, the participants were dismissed. The con duct of the entire experiment (instructions included) , for the entire group, took approximately 1 hour. 9 2. Hypotheses Our design ensures that heterogeneous time preferences cannot account for differences in behavior across types or treatments; similarly, our lottery payment scheme also controls for risk - preference heterogeneity. For any expected utility maximizing agent with wealth/income parameters as described above, the optimal strategy is to invest. This gen erates the following hypothesis: i n all income. However, if agents are motivated by other factors, such as social comparison or envy, we might observe decisions that are inconsistent with this hypothesis, but only in t he Observe and Info treatments where choices may be influenced by knowledge of the circumstances of others. In the baseline treatments, where social comparison is impossible, we should observe no such differences. Specifically, this generates the following alternative hypothesis, low - - Observe (Wealth - Observe) and Income - Info (Wealth - Info) treatment s , but equally likely in the baseline treatments. 3. Experimental Results In this section, we first describe summary statistics for each treatment, and then we report regression analysis to support our conclusions. Figure 1 displays the probability that a participant note that in every treatment consistently with the predictions of expected utility maximization. More important for our purposes, note there are no substant ial differences in the behavior of Rich and Poor types within either of the baseline treatments. For the Wealth treatment , those that were Poor invested at a rate of 8 8 percent while the Rich invested at a rate of 8 1 percent (two - sided proportion test, p - v alue = 0.63) . In the Income treatment , the Poor invested at a rate of 75 percent while the Rich invested at a rate of 73 percent (two - sided proportion test, p - value = 0.92) . The lack of differences across types in the baseline treatments is an important point to note. We see that although participants were aware that differences in Wealth or Income existed, the fact that they were not aware to which group they belonged caused them to invest at essentially the same rate. 10 Next w e turn to the effects of the Observe treatment. From Figure 1 it appears that in the Wealth treatment, both Rich and Poor types are somewhat less likely to invest under the Observe condition. In the Wealth treatment the low - wealth types reduced their rate of investment from 8 8 percent to 70 percent. In addition, the high - wealth types reduced their rate of investment from 8 1 percent to 70 percent. However, within the Wealth treatment, the effect is not statistically significant, either for individual types o r pooling across types (two - sided proportion tests, p - values > 0.15) . Under the Observe condition in the Income treatment, only the low - income types reduce their investment rate, while high - learning about previous choices made by other participants. Specifically, the Rich increas e their investment rate from 73 percent to 85 percent while the Poor types decrease from 75 percent from 60 percent. In the Income treatment, the effect of the Observe condition is not statistically significant within either type (two - sided proportion test s, p - values > 0.34), but when we compare Rich and Poor types under the Observe condition, the difference is marginally significant (two - sided proportion test, p - value = 0.07) . 11 The results are strikingly similar for the Info condition in both the Wealth and I ncome treatments. In the Wealth - Info treatment, both Rich and Poor types reduce their rate of investment to 67 percent, down from 81 and 88 percent in the Baseline. Again, thoug h, these differences are not statistically significant , either comparing individual types or pooling across types (two - sided p roportion tests, all p - values > 0.14 ) . Moreover, comparing Rich and Poor in the Income - Info condition to their corresponding types in the Baseline, we see that Poor types reduce their rate of investment from 75 to 57 percent, while Rich types increase their investment rate from 73 to 82 percent. In the Income treatment, this effect is not statis tically significant within either type (two - sided p roportion tests, p - values > 0.25 ), but when we compare Rich and Poor types under the Info condition, the difference is again marginally significant (two - sided proportion test, p - value = 0.08 ). Given the ov erwhelming similarity of the results between the Info and Observe treatments, we are confident that social comparison (and not additional information about conditional success probabilities) drives our results. Moreover, we pool the data from these treatme nts for the remainder of the analysis. To provide additional statistical support for the foregoing observations, we report estimates from two logistic regression models where the dependent variable takes a value of 1 the simplest model, the results of which are reported in Column (1) of Table 2, our independent variables include an intercept and dummy variables for high Wealth , high Income , and the Observe /Info t reatment s as well as an interaction between Income and Observe /Info . 3 O ur second spec ification, reported in Column (2 ), also introduces the information collected in our post - experiment survey: a male gender dummy, a dummy variable indicating whether the su bject reports having a savings account, a dummy variable indicating whether the subject reports paying for some or all of their college education, and continuous variables measuring risk and time preferences. F or all model specifications, the availability of information about others income had a marginally statistically significant , negative impact on investment. Thus, 3 We do not interact Wealth and Observe/Info because there is no evidence for an interaction in Figure 1. The results are qualitatively similar if we include separate Obs erve and Info dummies as well as the relevant interactions. 12 inconsistent with the simple rational model, knowing significantly impacted behavior. However, as we further decompose the treatment effect, we can see that the impact of this information is not consistent across types . The table reveal s that such information increases investment by high - income p articipants in the Income treatment . Moreover , a Wal d test provides evidence consistent wit h the proportions test above of significant differences be tween the Rich and Poor types (p - value = 0.042 , two - sided test). Finally, a negative and significant coefficient on the risk variable indicates that more risk averse subjects are less likely to invest (despite the fact that our payment method is designed to control for risk preferences). Table 2.

Perhaps surprisingly, the effect of social comparison on investment is negative for both high - and low - wealth types when they ha ve low income. Only high - income types increase their investment 13 rate in the Observe treatment. These findings are consistent with the presence of malicious envy - inco me types (which includes both low - and high - types in the Wealth treatment and low - types in the Income treatment) are significantly less likely to receive the $10 additional payment than high - 4 This fact becomes all the more clear when we reveal the wealth and income differences in the Observe and Info treatments. The reduction in investment by all low - income types may thus be driven by knowledge of this fundamental disadvantage. On the other ha nd, the high - income types are motivated by their relatively higher expected success rate and are thus encouraged to invest by social comparison. Importantly, with our design we can say with certainty that responsiveness to Under the incentive mechanism we employ, subjects have a clear dominant strategy to invest, regardless of the treatment; this suggests that our evidence for the impact of social comparison is likely a lower - bound. In essence, i f we offered some people a 25 % and 65% chance of finding $10 on the ground if they only looked down, this offer would seem appealing to a majority of both groups. However, when the lower probability group realizes that there is another group with a greater chance (although independent ) of success it causes them to become discouraged. In the same light , when people in the higher probability group realize that they have a higher probability of success (although independent), it causes them to increase effort. 4. Conclusion In a simple life - cycle consumption and investment tas k, we find evidence that social - comparison increases the rate of suboptimal investment choices among the income - poor. We argue that this is driven by malicious envy which operates by discouraging those who are less likely to benefit from their investments despite that fact that investment by all types leads to the same increase in expected utility. Previous research by social scientists and neuroscientists is clear in that the poor make decisions that are suboptim al. However the debate is much more about why. 5 If researchers can 4 Recall that the expected gain from investment is independent of treatment and type, so expected utility maximizing 5 See e.g. the recent debate over t he direction of causality, that is, whether poverty itself encourages suboptimal decisions (Mani et al. 2013, Wicherts and Scholten 2013). 14 understand the mechanism leading to these decisions, policy prescriptions can be formulated to alter such behavior and improve the lives of the poor . In this work, we note the importance o f social comparison and highlight differential behavioral responses to relative poverty caused by wealth and income. For example, Section 8 housing in the United States is an example of non - organic mixed income communities where lower income individuals ar e given housing subsidies to live in better neighborhoods. The hope being that lower income individuals will see and emulate the more stable characteristics of their neighbors by social comparison. If however, the very act of social comparison leads to dis couragement, the policy might require some adjustment.

If you have any questions, please raise your hand, and a monitor will come to your seat and answer your question privately. Any vi olation of this rule excludes you immediately from the experiment and all payments. In this study, you will participate in an experiment in economic decision - making. You will make decisions that affect your payment, so please carefully read these instructi ons. At the beginning of the experiment, you will start with a certain level of wealth , which is measured in dollars . This is money that is guaranteed to be paid to you at the end of the experiment. People may have different initial wealths, but you will only be informed about your own wealth. You will also receive an income in each period. Your income is measured in points . Points increase your probability of winning an additional $10 . Your point total at the end of the experiment will determine your prob ability of winning the additional amount. People may have different incomes, but you will only be informed about your own income. In the first period, when you receive your income , you must choose to invest or not invest . If you choose to invest : Your inc ome will be reduced by 1 point and the remaining added to your point total. A coin flip will determine your income for the next period. o If the coin reads heads your income will increase by 3 points. o If the coin reads tails your income will remain the same. If you choose to not invest : Your income will be added to your point total. You are guaranteed to have the same income in the next period. The experiment will last for 2 periods . You will decide whether to invest or not invest in the first period, and in the second period, your entire income will automatically be added to your point total . Your point total at the end of the experiment is calculated as follows: Point Total = Income in Period 1 Investment in Period 1 + Income in Period 2 Suppose your income is X points. If you choose to not invest , your point total at the end of the experiment will be: (X 0) + X = 2X points. 17 If you choose to invest , then the experimenter will flip a coin. If the coin reads tails , your poin t total at the end of the experiment will be (X 1) + X = 2X 1 points. If the coin reads heads , your point total at the end of the experiment will be (X 1) + (X + 3) = 2X + 2 points. Your point total determines your probability of receiving an add itional $10. After your point total has been determined, the experimenter will roll a ten - sided die to determine whether you will receive the additional $10. If the number rolled is less than or equal to your point total we will add $10 to your wealth , whi ch is guaranteed to be paid to you at the end of the experiment. If the number rolled is greater than your point total, your wealth will remain unchanged. Note that the die is labeled from 0 - 9, but we will consider a roll of 0 to be a 10. On the record she et in front of you, you will see your total wealth and your income . When the experiment begins, you will decide whether to invest or not invest . When you are finished making your decision, please turn your record sheet face down. Once everyone has finished, the experimenter will call you one - by - one to the front of the room. If you chose invest , the experimenter will flip the coin to determine your income for period 2. Then, once your point total has been determined, the experiment er will roll the ten - sided die to determine whether you receive additional payment. You will take your record sheet to another experimenter to receive your payment, and then you may leave. To maintain privacy, we will be processing payments one at a time, so you will need to quietly wait your turn to receive your payment. Remember, anyone who communicates with others while waiting will be excused from the experiment without payment.
