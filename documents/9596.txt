We offer a wealth of programs and services to help students thrive both during their time at the UofM and beyond graduation. However, students may not always know where to go to plug into these opportunities. To help ensure an exceptional educational experience for everyone, we are creating the UofM Student Experience. The initiative will connect students with information and access to opportunities like Academic Coaching for Excellence, the TRIO Scholarship program, Finish Line, Degree Pathway and Multicultural Affairs. Today’s students face an array of challenges, with many juggling school and work in an effort to cover the escalating costs of higher education and reduce long-term debt. Central to the mission of the University of Memphis is a firm commitment to access and diversity, alongside an unwavering dedication to delivering an exceptional comprehensive education, one that provides a foundation for lifelong learning. The UofM Student Experience will provide a means to capture the creativity and input of our students, faculty and staff, monitor our progress, test new programs, coordinate cross-college efforts and explore new options, all with the goal of enhancing student success. Steven Mizell has agreed to serve as coordinator of the UofM Student Experience while continuing in his current position in Enrollment Services. We will provide updates on the UofM Student Experience in the coming weeks. Go Tigers! M. David Rudd President Karen Weddle-West Provost Bookmark the permalink .
