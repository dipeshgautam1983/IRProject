University of Memphis and the Department of Psychology The University of Memphis Opened in 1912 , t he University of Memphis has de veloped into an internationally - recognized institution of higher learning. T oday the University educates approximately 23 ,000 students annually, including over 4,000 graduate students . Conveniently located in an attractive residential section of Memphis, t he University includes 1,160 acres and 202 buildings at eight sites. The University is comprised of eleven distinct academic colleges and schools: the School of Public Health, the College of Arts and Sciences, Fogelman College of Business and Economics, Loewenberg School of Nursing, the School of A udiology and Speech - Language Pathology, Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law , the College of Communication and Fine Arts, the College of Education, Herff College of Engineering, the University College, and the Graduate School . Although individual schools function as separate entities, each academic division at the University of Memphis is dedicated to the scholarly advancement of its students and faculty and to the betterment of the community. The University of Memphis has vib rant collaborations with a number of well - known resources in Memphis, including St. , the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center, the VA M edical Center, LeBonheur Pediatric Research Hospital, and Memphis City Schools . The Psychology Department Housed both in its own building and in the Federal Express Institute for Emerging Technology, the psychology de partment offers doctoral degrees in clinical, experimental, and Psychology. The clinical Ph.D. program has been continuously accredited by the American Psychological Association since 197 National Association of School Psychology (NASP). The Ph.D. in School Psychology Program was just accredited by the American Psychological Association in August 2014. In 1984, the Psychology De partment's Center for Applied Psychological Research (CAPR) was recognized by the State of Tennessee as an academic Center of Excellence (COE ). Four years later the department was named as an Accomplished Center of Excellence. As a result, the department enjoys special benefits. The CAPR receives a permanent annual financial award from the state , funds which are available to attract outstanding, nationally - recognized faculty, to facilitate research opportunities, and to offset project costs. Thus, resear ch is a key element of the department mission . Clinical Program Manual 5 5 Organization of the Department Psychology faculty and doctoral students belong to one of three programs: the clinical program, the experimental program, or the school program (which includes both a master s and a doctoral program) . In addition, ( M.S. in General Psychology ). We also have over 800 undergraduate psychology majors studying in our department. R esearch A reas You will find that facu lty and student research interests in clinical psychology cluster into 3 main topics : Clinical Health Psychology , Child and Family Research , and Psychotherapy Research . These r esearch areas represent our common interests . In addition, they also help promote collaboration among indivi duals from different programs. For example, the Child and Family research area is comprised of students and faculty from clinical, experimental, and school doctoral programs , as well as MSGP students. In develo ping your professional identity, you should think of yourself first and foremost as a student in clinical psychology . In addition, you may find that your specific research and clinical interests map onto one of our research areas. For example, you might b e a clinical student with specific interests in Clinical Health research. Not all students have interests that match a research area clearly, but many do . Although w e offer a generalist program in clinical psychology , e ach research area has arranged 2 - 3 specialized courses and expectations for that you conduct related research. Sometimes students are involved in more tha n one research area , because their interests lie on the cusp of the two areas. In this case , we allow students to create their own interest area , usually by blending existing areas (e.g., taking one course from Child an d Family and one from Clinical Health) or substituting a course in a different area (e.g., an advanced statistics/methods course, a course in public health) for one of the area requirements. If a student wants to create their own research area , s/he should approach their how a unique researc h area might meet their needs. The Major Professor and student can work to gether to come up with training experiences that would be comparable to other research areas but in the topics of t The student would then write up a plan for his/her research area requirements, submitting that plan to the Maj or Professor, DCT, and clinical faculty during spring evaluations (you can detail the plan in the Annual Performance Review Form you complete each May for your yearly evaluation) . The plan will then be reviewed for approval with the ir other evaluation mat erials. Approval of the plan will be communicated in the spring evaluation letter. For example, you might choose to develop an emphasis in quantitative methods or public health by taking additional courses in those areas instead of the three areas describ ed above. All students should have a research area declared or created by the time of their 3 rd year spring evaluations . This plan should allow the students sufficient time to complete their planned research, clinical, and coursework goals. Clinical Program Manual 6 6 The Faculty T he University of Memphis Psychology Department consists of approximately 3 0 full - time faculty members, 2 0 adjunct faculty (psychologists in the community who teach and/or supervise our students), 5 postdoctoral f ellows, 90 doctoral students, 58 students, and over 7 00 undergraduate majors and minors.

Computer Help C ontact Lavaire Lockhart for computer help: llockhar@memphis.edu and be sure to place a help ticket as well G ENERAL I NFORMATION : T HINGS Keys Keys to offices and labs are maintained by staff in the main office. Keys for labs require consent (a note, email, or call) from the faculty assigned the lab indicating the room(s) for which you need a key and the semester time frame for which you will be using it. Students will be r equired to fill out a card when obtaining key(s). Students are responsible for the security of the keys and for returning the keys when they are no longer needed. If keys are not returned when requested, a cting registration, transcripts and receipt of diploma. Security Grad students are typically in the building at all hours. As always, you should be careful about security. There are red security phones ON THE FIRST, SECOND AND FOURTH FLOOR. Pick up the receiver and you will be automatically connected to campus police. You can call the campus police general number for non - emergencies such as being locked out of your office at night (678 - 3848). The emergency number to police services is 678 - 4537 (678 - HELP). Tiger Patrol is a personal escort program staffed by students to enhance the safety of persons on campus in the evening.

(Note: Use of the escort program as a "tax i" for convenience rather than safety is discouraged, e.g. multiple people wanting a ride because it is raining. Use in this manner detracts from their ability to provide other services. Please do NOT call for an escort after dawn, as their normal duties r estrict them from providing service after that time.) Clinical Program Manual 9 9 Parking General Parking ( is paid for through the Maintenance Fee portion of semester tuition. Once the student has registered for classes, a semester validation stick er will be mailed to the address on file with the Student Records Department. New students are mailed a permit (hangtag) along with a semester validation sticker prior to Fee Payment. The permits (hangtags) run on a three - year cycle and need to be updated every semester. If, for any reason, you do not receive the semester validation sticker or permit through mail, you need to go to the Parking Office the first week of class to obtain one. The semester validation sticker should be placed on the right side of permit. This validates the permit (hangtag) to be used in General Parking Lots only .

If you are interested in meeting with a psychologist in the comm unity we can refer you to individuals who may see students with a sliding fee schedule. Your Assistantship /Stipend Student s earn their stipend (presently $14 ,000 per year before y ou earn your degree; $15 ,000 afterward , with the raise beginning the fall after you defend your thesis and officially graduate with your masters ) by working 20 hours a week, on a 12 - month schedule. Time off from duties for vacation, illness, travel, or holidays may be taken. Typically these includ e university holidays a nd several additional weeks . Graduate students who are funded by faculty grants, or other outside graduate student funding positions such as clinical placements, have their own leave policies. Each student should ask the placement supervisor about leave policy. Time off should be scheduled and negotiated in advance with the supervising faculty member. This work -- is a key part of your training. Our department guarantees at least 4 years of funded assistantship t raining , as long as you remain in good stand ing , but over the past 10 years we have provide d funding for a fifth year for all students in good standing . Additionally, s tudents who receive an assistantship do not pay tuition or fees . We have increased our stipends by $3,000 over the past four years and our stipend amount is consistent with the average stipend level n ationwide for university based Clinical Ph . D. P rograms , despite below average cost of living in Memphis. During your first year in our program, you will probably be assigned as a research assistant to your major professor. After that first year, you must work as a research assistant for one additional year, and another year must be spent on a clinical placement su ch as the PSC, one of our clinical research grants, or an external clinical placem ent (this could be 20 hours in one year or ten hours across two years) . After fulfilling these requirements, you have a number of options, including serving as a research ass istant again, gaining further clinical experience, working as a teaching assistant, or tea ching an undergraduate course. Assistant ship/Placement Assignment Process. You will have a chance to express your ent decisions are made each summer (typically in June/July) for the following year. Assignment s are made by the DCT and the pl acement committee ( currently Drs. McDevitt - Murphy and Howell ). Decisions are made after considering your training needs (e.g., wh ether you have completed your required clinical and research placement), your preferences, the fit between your skills/experiences and the needs of the placement, and the preferences of the placement supervisor. Most placements will also interview student s to help them determine your fit. Typically students receive one of their top few choices but given the limited supply of placement slots this cannot be guaranteed. G enerating new placements . The DCT and other members of the clinical faculty are continuously exploring ne w placement possibilities. We are fortunate to have an adequate number of paid place ments right now , including 3 new clinical placements in 2015 - 201 6 . Because it is typically not possible for clinics and hospitals to get reimbur sed for services provided by non - licensed graduate students, i t is difficult to find plac ements that are willing to pay for your stipend plus provide the requisite clinical supervision by a l icensed clinical psychologist. We are grateful that we have clini cal placements and count on you to do an exceptional job in these placements so the sites continue to fund our students. Please let the DCT know if you have ideas about new clinical or research placements! Most importantly , please let the DCT or another member of the placement committee know if you experience a difficulty or conflict while on placement. A listing of our 2015 2016 placements is included in Appendix C. Clinical Program Manual 13 13 All Outside Work (volunteer and paid) Must Be Approved Your assistantship and your other responsibilities in the department (including coursework, thesis, etc.) are c onsidered a full - time endeavor. This means that while you are a student in the program, you sh ould not accept any outside emplo yment without DCT approval . If you are conside ring a non - departmental job, discuss it with your M ajor P rofessor and then make a written request to the DCT . The request needs to include the job title, description of responsibilities, name and contact information of employer (and supervisor), and propos ed dates of employment and hours. Mentors should receive a copy of t he written request. The mentor and DCT will jointly make a decision about the advisability of the external position . This decision will be based in part on your demonstrated ability to c omplete mandatory program training elements (your coursework, milestones, placement activities, and PSC responsibilities) in a timely manner. We want to assure you that there is a good reason that we review external work experiences. In the State of Tenn essee, licensure is required in order to perform certain types of professional services. The only exception occurs when your training program has a relationship with your supervisor. Therefore, even if a licensed psychologist supervises you, unless that person has the approval of the clinical program, you may be violating the law by practicing without a license . In fact, e ven if a faculty member supervises you for private work (not part of the program), you should touch base w ith the DCT for clarificatio n. We do have a number of sanctioned volunteer opportunities (there are referred to as practicum ) described below. Diversity at the University of Memphis The University of Memphis will promote and ensure equal opportunity for all persons without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability status, age or status as a qualified veteran with a disability or veteran of the Vietnam era. Our Office for Institutional Equity website is . memphis.edu/oie/ . We have a broad program of services and academic accommodations designed to provide access and opportunity to qualified students with disabilities through Disability Resources for Students , . memphis.edu/drs / . If you have a disability , DRS will make recommendations to your program without revealing the nature of your disability. More generally, as a graduate student in this diverse city we encourage you to take advantage of the opportunities to gain experience relevant to diversity. For example, please visit the Civil Rights Museum to learn more about discrimination faced by African Americans and others in the United States. Finally, as noted below, the program also values training in diversi ty and requires that all students develop the ability to work with a diverse population of individuals in terms of age, ethnicity, race, disability, and sexual orientation. There is also a required psychotherapy course focused on diversity. Our diversity - related expectations for clinical students. Students are expected to demonstrate respect for diversity. Diversity means the fair representation of all groups of individuals, the inclusion of minority perspectives and voices, and the appreciation of different cultural and socioeconomic group practices. The University of Memphis aspires to foster and maintain an atmosphere that is free from discrimination, harassment, exploitation, or intimidation. We expect that you will treat clients and research participants with respect and dignity regardless of their affiliations or associations with sexual identity, multicultural, cultural, international or socioeconomic issues or any underrepresented populations. In addition, the American Psychological Associ ation (APA) has explicit policies regarding the issues of and writing about race, gender, class, Clinical Program Manual 14 14 sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, and religion. These standards can be found in the Publication ce of Ethnic Minority Affairs ( ). Based on our academic judgment as to the best preparation for clinical psychologists, our program is committed to providing training that will prepare all students to work with client populations that are diverse with respect to a variety of characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, disability status). Students completing clinical training in our program are required to provid e services to all clients deemed appropriate by their supervisors. Finally, it is important to note that h arassment, discrimination, and other such behaviors that undermine our supportive climate are unacceptable, and concerns about these behaviors can be expressed to your DCT, the Director of Graduate Training, the Chair, the Department Diversity Committee, or the university Office for Institutional Equity . Additional Resources The University of Memphis offers a number of services and organizations to ass ist you in implementing a classroom environment that helps ensure the safety, involvement, and success of all students, including the following: The Office of Institutional Equity ( ) monitors the University's policy on equal opportunity and affirmative action in employment and education and provides resources such as the Welcoming Diversity tutorial ( ng.newmedialearning.com/diversity/umemphis/ ) Disability Resources for Students ( ) helps ensure equal access to all university programs and activities for students with disabilities, hel ps all members of the university community understand and accommodate their needs, and promotes the independence of such students. The University of Memphis Office of Multicultural Affairs ( http: // ) provides a supportive environment that advises students of color with regard to their academic, social, cultural, and financial affairs. The office is home to several student organizations, including the Black Stud ent Association, Black Scholars Unlimited, Empowered Men of Color, the Hispanic Student Association, and the University of Memphis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The Center for Research on Women ( ) conducts, promotes, and disseminates scholarship on women and social inequality, with particular emphasis on the relationships among race, class, gender and sexuality in the experience of Southern women. It supports a variety of events in the university and community to highlight the contributions and achievements of women including films, lectures, performances and awards. Students for Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Awareness ( ) is committed to diversity and civility in our department and across campus and offers a welcoming environment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, an d Transgendered students. It supports a SafeZone Program ( ). International Students Office ( ) supports the international population at The University of Memphis by providing advice on immigration matters, employment, taxation, cultural adjustment, and other practical issues. The office conducts an Clinical Program Manual 15 15 international student orientation each semester, coordinates insurance information, and assists student groups. Clinical Program Manual 16 16 PART II: Being a Graduate Student in Our Clinical Program Our Model of Training Our clinical Ph.D. program is a Boulder M odel program . Consistent with the consensus statement issued by the National Conference on Scientist - Practitioner Education and Training for the Professional Practice of Psychology (Belar & Perry, 1992), we aim to train graduates who are attitudes, and skills so as to further psychological science, the professional practice of psychology, practitioner, and may function as either or both, consistent wi th the highest standards of Thus , our program aims to provide excellent training in research and research - based clinical work. [See Tanner & Danielson (2007) for more information on the characteristics of scientist - practitioner progr ams.] Graduates from our clinical program typically become employed in positions in which they combine their clinical and research skills, such as positions in medical school settings, academic departments, and research hospitals. A minority of our graduates work in settings that are exclusively clinical or exclusively research. Consequently, w e expect all of our students to develop clinical expertise and to be actively engaged in research (above and beyond milestone projects) duri ng their entire time in the program , irrespective of their ultimate career goals . For example, all students are expected to attend researc h conferences, submit papers for publication , and to continually develop their clinical skills through out their time i n our program (e.g., to see clients for 3 years in the PSC, complete psychotherapy classes and clinical placements) . We expect that your future career will involve some combination of research and clinical work, likely changing over time in response to dyn amic market pressures and your preferences , so please consciously develop both skill sets (in addition to skills related to teaching, consultation/supervision, and dissemination/outreach) . demonstrated in its membership in the Academy of Psychological Clinical Science , a group of scientifically - oriented clinical and health psychology doctoral programs in the Unite d States and Canada. Member schools must demonstrate strong commitments to, and successful records in, training in clinical science. Program Values: Evidence Based Practice and Diversity Training. The program has a strong commitment to training in evide nce - based approaches to the assessment and treatment of behavioral and psychological problems. This means that clinical decisions should be as data - driven as possible, and that students should gain expertise in evidence based practices for a variety of co mmon psychological complaints. For more information on evidence based practice see the following links: EBBP website: EBBP skills based resource page: Cochrane Collaboration website for systematic reviews: Clinical Program Manual 17 17 NICE treatment g uidelines: IOM guidelines page: - Practice - Guidelines - We - Can - Trust.aspx As noted earlier, t he program also values training in diversity and requires that all students develop the ability to work with a diverse population of individuals in terms of age, ethnicity, race, disability, and sexual orientation. Please talk to the DCT if this conflicts with your personal values or training goals. Admissions Process Students are admitted t o our program through a careful selection process that evaluates a fit with our program and a specific mentor. Selection of students depends not only on their academic expertise, but also on their letters of recommendatio n, interest match our program model and our faculty, and our impres sion of the stu dents during their interview. We also greatly value diversity in this program, and we carefully review the applications of all minority candidates who might be a good fit with our program. Being a Professional and Developing a Professional Work Ethic Y ou will be expected to be a professional from day one when you work in your lab (potentially interacting with research participants) and begin conducting assessments in your core clinical classes. Being considere d professional assumes that you have a high degree of skill and act according to the APA ethical guidelines ( ). Although ethical training will be an important part of your education, you should start by carefully reading and understanding your responsibility f or the APA ethical guidelines. Although you typically you are now a 12 - month employee of the Unive rsity and you are expected to contribute to the research mission of the u niversity year - round. You will be expected to invest yourself actively in the reading and learning that academic education entails . How much you enjoy your graduate training will dep end largely on how much you invest in it (particularly self - directed learning that takes place in your lab, at conferences, and in hours spend reading and writing in various locations). Successful g raduate students develop a year - round p attern of work that is similar to medical school and far exceeds undergraduate workloads or a 40 - hour work week. In sum: work hard in graduate school, you will wind up enjoying it more because you will excel, you will worry less about finding a good internship and postdoc , and it will open up doors throughout your career. As a professional - in - training, you should be aware of the manner in which you present the profes sion to the world. Y ou should learn how to dress professionally and how to handle yourself in a profession al context . y monitor your communications. You will also learn that once you represent your profession, your behavior has important consequences not only at work , but also in the world at large . Your profession becomes part of your identity, which you cannot simply remove when you exit work. Clinical Program Manual 18 18 Please keep in mind that you may run into a client or student when you are out socializing and behave in way that would not compromise your professional rep utation. This applies to behavior on s ocial media as well : Responsibilit ies Regarding Online Activities /Social Media In an increasingly technologically connected and public world, students are encouraged to remain mindful of your behavior and its consequences online, including the use of social networking, blogs, listservs, and email. It is likely that students, clients, supervisors, potential internship sites, research participants, and future employers may be interested in searching or accessing online information about you. While all of the information that may exist about you may not be within your control, students are urged to exercise caution and restraint and to utilize safeguards when possible. Activities online, including those that you ma y consider purely personal in nature, may unfortunately reflect upon your professional life. Keep in mind the ideals of the preamble to the APA ethics code in which we aspire to do no harm to our clients, our research participants, or the profession with o ur actions. With this in mind, you are encouraged to consider the following cautions and suggestions: 1. With social networking sites such as Facebook, utilize privacy settings to limit access to your pages and personal information. Use thoughtful discreti on when considering supervisory or evaluative responsibilities (studen ts in the classes you TA) , or with supervisors who evaluate you. 2. With email, keep in mind that everything you write may exist perpetually or be retrievable, so be thoughtful about what you write. Emails sent via the Memphis email system are considered public records and the property of the University. Participation in listservs include the peril of inadvertently writing things to a much more public audience than intended, so be cautious with posts to such forums. Email is not an appropriate venue to dis cuss confidential information, so if such communications are necessary make sure any information is encrypted . 3. and credentials. Students are encouraged to consider addin g a confidentiality disclaimer to email signature files. 4. Be mindful of voicemail greetings if you utilize a private phone for any professional purposes (clinical work, teaching, or research). Make sure that such messages reflect a maturity and professi onalism that you would want to portray to the public. 5. Online photo and video sharing, including within social networking sites, should be considered very public venues, and use discretion when posting such information. It is not the intention of the c linical psychology program to interfere in your personal life or to limit your ability to enjoy the benefits of online activities, express your personality or opinions, or have a little fun. As with off - line activity, we encourage you to be mindful of the implications and make efforts to protect your professional image and reputation. If the program becomes aware of online activity that represents a violation of the APA Code of Ethics, local, state or federal laws, such information may be included in evalu ation of student progress and may be grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal from the program. Clinical Program Manual 19 19 Expectation for Active Engagement in the Department and Program In addition to your routine duties as a graduate student, part of the graduate school learning experience involved being an active member of the clinical program and the wider department. T here are many ways for you to become more involved in the department. We expect that you will be fully involved with our applicant interview day each year, including hosting applicants and participating in meals and group interviews. Each year we hold colloquia on various topics in psyc hology. Our weekly Clinical Forum ( - forum - schedule - fall20 14.pdf ) for clinical doctoral students will give you an opportunity not only to present your own research, but also to hear from community psy Students are also expected to attend job talks conducted each time the dep artment recruits a new faculty member . Clinical Forum occurs most Friday mornings from 9:00 AM 10:00 AM during the Fall and Spring Semesters. You will also find that the larger university provides a rich environment in which to broaden your skills throug h interaction with other professionals. Active participation and attendance at lab meetings, forum meetings, and other department colloquiums is expected and will be part of the criteria used to evaluate you each year. E xternal placements should allow you to attend these functions please talk with me if you are having difficulty negotiating that release time . Working Effectively with your Mentor and Other Faculty Members At entry into the doctoral program, each student is matched with a M ajor P rofessor /Advisor , who will serve as the main guide as a student works to develop a professional identity. One of your goals as a first year student should be to develop a comfortable working relationship with your mentor. Try to maintain weekly or bi - weekly meetin gs even before you may be working on specific papers and other projects. He/she will need to get to know you and your professional interests in order to provide appropriately tailored career advice and eventually to be able to convey your unique interests and skills in letters of recommendations. Although your mentor will most likely become your most important professional influence in graduate school (and likely an enduring influence and collaborator throughout your career) , he or she is not your onl y source of advice or guidance. Y ou can benefit a good deal from other faculty member s whose resea rch or professional interest s match you own. Keep in mind that you r mentor is a busy professional with nume rous responsibilities, including maintaining a nati onally recognized program of research. Unlike private liberal arts colleges where faculty are evaluated primarily on teaching and mentoring, at Ph . D . granting research universities like the U of M faculty are e xpected to maintain highly visible programs o f research, and decisions about tenure and promotion are heavily tied to research productivity. Consequently, i t is important to think of your relationship with your mentor as being a reciprocal professional working partnership rather than a unidirectional relationship where you receive mentoring. Your mentor will devote an incredible amount of time to mentoring you and advancing your career, and likewise you should devote substantial effort to contributing to the research mission of your lab, above and bey ond your paid RA hours, your milestone projects and particular papers that you might take the lead on. You r work in your lab is also a primary experiential element of your training in the Ph.D. model. Expectations for turnaround time on your manuscript and milestone drafts. As mentors we have agreed to attempt to give you feedback on your work products within two weeks. We agreed to this because we want to do all we can to allow you to make rapid progr ess. However, there will be times when you mentor will be unable to meet this expectation, due to travel, illness, or other Clinical Program Manual 20 20 pressing work commitments (grant applications, grading, etc.). Most importantly, faculty are generally able to turn around high qua lity drafts more quickly, so make every effort to turn in your best work only after you have edited and reread it several times. Do not expect faculty to turn your rough draft into a finished product. If your mentor consistently is unable to meet the two week expectation please talk with her/him about this and also feel free to talk with the DCT or Graduate Coordinator. Annual Mentor - Mentee Contracts . Please schedule a meeting at the beginning of each academic year to discuss mutual expectations for th e upcoming year, as well as to discuss any feedback or concerns related to your work with your mentor over the previous year. During this meeting your mentor will let you know what they expect from you in the lab for the next year, and discuss your specifi c role and expectations related to lab projects and papers. You should use this meeting to plan your milestone progress (including a timeline for drafts and meetings) and discuss and specific training experiences you would like to receive from your lab/men tor over the next year. Please also discuss your plans for attending conferences during the next year. Should I refer to a faculty member by their first name or call him/her Dr.? Although many fac ulty members (including the DCT ) prefer to communicate with graduate students on a first name basis , it is generally best to go with Dr. when addressing a faculty member or external supervisor unless you are sure he/she prefers that you use their first name. You can simply ask them their preference or talk to other students who have experien ce with that individual . Changing Major Professors Because we have a mentor model and students are admitted to work with a particular professor, we assume that you will work with your mentor during your entire time in our program. C hanging Major Professors is a significant decision that must be made only after much thought and discussions with your current Major Professor, the DCT, and the Graduate Coordinator . A M ajor P rofessors typically reflect research or career interests. O ccasionally, personality conflicts lead students to chang e M ajor P rofessors. If you want to change major professors , Drs. Murphy and/or Cohen are available to help. Student Evaluations Each year at the end of the s pring semester , clinical students complete a self - evaluation form recording their grades, resear ch progress, level of engagement in program activities (e.g., forum and other colloquium attendance), and lab and clinical work. This in cludes a n updated CV and summary of program progress/goals (Overview Form) , form s rating research and clinical competencies, and a listing of documented competencies in the administration of empirically supported treatments. Evaluations are also collected from clinical supervisors, research supervisors, and off - site placement and practica supervisors . You should obtain a clinical evaluation form for every setting in which you provided clinical services, including your lab and volunteer (practicum) experiences . Students review all of these materials in a meeting with their M ajor P ro fessor . This meeting should help each student to evaluate their own progress and set goals for their development over the following academic year . The clinical faculty t hen meet s and carefully discusses the data on each student After the faculty meeting each student receive s a letter from the DCT summarizing his or her research and applied skills, knowledge, and credentials. The primary purpo se of this annual Clinical Program Manual 21 21 evaluation process is to provide feedback to students concerning their progress through the training program. We aim to help you recognize your strengths and weaknesses as you go through training, choose activities that will enhance your skills , and identify goals that will improve your marketability . First year students and students who receive a rating of or Needs Improvement Sample Clinical Program E valuation fo rms are included in Appendix A . Here are the criteria that faculty use in evaluating students: 5 = Exceptional : Exceeding expectations in multiple domains research, clinical work and coursework as evidenced by publications and positive feedback from clinical supervisors; active engagement in lab and program, good milestone progress. Advanced students (3 rd year and higher) rated as exceptional will typically have one or more first author papers accepted for publication in the previous year, a grant su bmission, or multiple past - year c o - authored papers; first and 2 nd year students may earn this rating for submitting one or more first author manuscripts or contributing to multiple co - authored papers, and making exceptional contributions to their lab while also exceeding standards in the classroom or clinic . 4 = Very Successful : Meeting expectations in all domains and exceeding in at least one domain for example a student with average clinical performance and exceptional research productivity or a student who received very strong reviews for his/her clinical work and is meeting expectations for research. 3 = Successful : Meeting expectations in all domains making good progress with classes and milestones, receiving satisfactory or better clinical ratings, actively contributing to his/her lab, and presenting research at conf erences. It is expected that all students in our program will be actively engaged in research and clinical work, as well as their lab, program, and department. 2 = Needs improvement : Not meeting expectations in one or more domains: inadequate progress with milestones, clinical development or poor engagement in lab or program activities. Lack of research engagement/productivity outside of milestone research (failing to present at conferences or submit manuscripts) ; interpersonal, work - ethic, or ethical concerns. 1 = Unsatisfactory : Substantially behind on milestone progress, interpersonal, work - ethic, or ethical concerns that are highly significant or chronic and have not improved with feedback. Failure to engage in suggested remediation for any ide ntified concerns. Expected Milestone Progress by the Time of the Spring (May) Evaluation Meeting These are broad, liberal guidelines that take into account the variability in student goals and effort level required to complete various milestone projec ts. This does not reflect an ideal timeline ( that is presented later in this manual ) but instead a minimal standard for the purposes of judging adequate milestone progress. Please be assured that s tud ents will not be penalized for being delinquent on milestone progress when their project is delayed due to factors beyond their control (e.g., delays related to IRB or participant recruit ment, equipment failure, etc.) especially if they are being productive in othe r areas of research (e.g., submitting other manuscripts). Falling more than 2 semesters behind on a milestone project could be considered problematic Clinical Program Manual 22 22 The clinica l faculty will determine specific consequences associated with this status on a case - by - case basis. First year - work to generate thesis idea Second year propose thesis, write IRB, begin data collection Third year - defend thesis, begin 2 nd milestone Fourth year Co mplete second milestone (by May 31 deadline), begin work on dissertation proposal Fifth year Prop ose dissertation by September 15 deadline (idea lly sooner ) , write I RB, collect dissertation data Withdrawing from the Program and Leaves of Absence Keep in mind that graduate school is a marathon rather than a sprint and that it is normal to have periods of uncertainty about career goals and variable levels of motivation. Almost all students find graduate school very difficult, particularly in contrast to the typically more relaxed undergraduate lifestyle, and are conflicted about the sacrifices required to obtain the Ph.D., so it is not unusual to feel this way. Occasionally students discover that their career interests have change d and withdraw from the program to pursue these other interests. Please sc hedule a meeting with the DCT if you are having thoughts about leaving the program . In some cases, a student may benefit from a Leave of Absence instead of a withdrawal, and the DCT can provide you with information ab out this option . Students should know that all graduate students in the Department of Psychology are expected to maintain continuous enrollment during the fall and spring semesters. A student who plans not to enroll for a semester or more must request a leave of absence in writing. The Leave of Absence Request Form must indicate the general reason for the request and specify the anticipated date of return. Submission of this form will be taken as confirmation that the st udent understands that GA funding upon return to the program will be based on the conditions approved by the program at the time the leave is granted contingent on budget availability . This request must be approved by the Program Director, Graduate Coordi nator, and Department Chair. This does not apply to students going on a program - required internship. The student should be aware that the university may require submission of an application for readmission to the University. Any extensions beyond the period initially requested must be justified and reapproved by all parties. Students who fail to return to the program at the end of their approved leave without notification to the program may be considered for termination from the graduate program. Leave forms are located at http:/ / . Maintaining Good Standing Good standing means that your progress has been judged as satisfactory by the clinical faculty. In making this assessment, the faculty expects that you are maintaining at lea st a B average, that you do not have a grade below a B in a core course, and that you are making satisfactory progress toward your degree on all measures that you are evaluated on (practicum, placements, lab work , Clinical Program Manual 23 23 courses , and professional behavior ). Please see both the Graduate Program Handbook and the University Bulletin for detailed information on required GPA, repetition of courses, and other such issues. Minimal timelines for milestone progress are noted above. The clinical faculty is committed to work ing with each student that we accept into the program. W e make every effort to h elp students who are struggling in order to facilitate succes sful completion of the program. We might, for example, design a plan for remediation, along with re - assessment after some determined interval, to assess progress. During this time we would provide as much support and direction as possible in an effort to help the student to succeed . Written feedback will be given to the student at the conclusion of a remediation program to clearly indicate whether the problem was successfully resolved, and the student has the opportunity to discuss the matter directly with the clinical faculty. Under very rare circumstances, a student may be ask ed to leave the program. Dismissal typically occur s after a period of time in which expectations for remediation are clearly stated. Reasons for dismissal can include a failure to perform adequately in courses, inadequate progress toward program milestones (such as thesis and dissertation), inadequate clinical or research work, poor productivity/work ethic, and unethi cal or unprofessional behavior. In the case of egregious misbehavior that cannot be safely rehabilitated, a student may be dismissed from the progra m without a period of attempt ed remediation following a majority vote from the clinical faculty. Program Evaluation (providing feedback to the program) Your opinions are crucial to the growth of the clinical doctoral program. We urge you to share ideas regarding the program with you r major professor and the DCT. There are several mechanisms through which we ask students to provide feed back about faculty performance. First, students complete anonymous course ratings (called S ETE S) at the end of each semester . These ratings become part n important basis for ev aluation of the faculty member. Similarly, you will use the SETES to evaluate your PSC supervision course as well. T hese ratings become part of the fa We will also ask you to complete yearly evaluations of external placements, which will be reviewed by the DCT and the placement committee. We also complete a bi - annual clinical student survey, which provides you with the opportunity to provide feedback related to the prog ram and the DCT. Finally, the DCT holds weekly office hours that provide an opportunity to discuss any concerns, as well as anonymous student surveys to identify student concerns . Providing feedback to the program. If you have an issue that you are unhappy about please talk to the appropriate people (your advisor, the DCT, chair, PSC director, graduate director, GSCC clinical program representative [currently Melissa Smigelsky] ) . If you have ideas for improving the program please convey them to the DCT or the clinical program representative. We have recently developed a DCT Advisory Committee to assist the DCT in keeping abreast of student feedback/suggestions. The committee inclu des several students (Rebecca Kamody, Jessica Tripp, Kristina Decker, Francisco Salgado - Garcia, and Melissa Smigelsky) and a postdoc ( Dr. Ashley Dennhardt) who are available to convey any program - related feedback or suggestions to the DCT. Please also use other forums such as course/assistantship evaluations and our anonymous clinical student surveys to provide constructive feedback. Even in these forums, however, please communicate professionally by avoiding extreme, personal, or overly general criticisms. Please view yourself as a part of this program (rather than as a consumer) and appreciate that you have a responsibility to contribute towards creating a positive and supportive environment. Clinical Program Manual 24 24 The GSCC Graduate students comprise the Graduate Student Coordi nating Committee (GSCC), which represents student interests and is allotted 3 votes at faculty meetings. (The GSCC representatives can also give you information about applying for fund s to attend conferences). Elections for GSCC po sitions are held once pe r year. In addition, each year the clinical students elect a representative to attend clinical faculty meetings (except those in which students are discussed). newsletter and current officers , go to: Student P articipation in the P rogram and the D epartment In addition to the student representation that is afforded by the GSCC, students are encouraged to take an active voice in the clini cal program. For example, the clinical student representative on the GSCC attends and participates in clinical faculty meetings (unless confidential student in formation is being discussed). Second, we recruit s tudents to assist wi th program - related activities, including the admissions process, providing input on accreditation materials, recruiting new faculty members, and constructing surveys to assess student opinion. Third , the DCT welcomes student input in a variety of ways, in cluding anonymous on - line surveys, informal forums with groups of students (including the DCT Advisory Group mentioned previously) , and one - on - one meetings . Finally , the DCT schedules informal meeting with student cohorts in the context of Clinical Forum . Grievance Procedures mediation to reduce/resolve conflict. The De partment has a plan for this. We recommend that you take the following actions for expressing conce rns, if possible, in this order: 1. Go to the person with whom you have a complaint and try to come to a resolution. 2. Go to your program director to address the issue (in your case, the DCT) . 3. Go to the G raduate C oordinator (Bob Cohen). 4. Form a G rievance Committee as specified below. 5. Place a written complaint in the mail box of the D epartment C hair person or Department Co - chair. 6. Go directly to the Chair or Co - chair to address the issue. At anytime you may go to a GSCC member to discuss the issue confidentially (if you desire, the GSCC representatives will meet with the appropriate administrator to inform them of the concern and/or to discuss possible ways to resolve the concern). You may also contact the GSCC by email or you can put a writte n complaint into the GSCC mailbox. Considerations for forming a Grievance Committee 1. A student acknowledges that by taking an issue to the Grievance Committee that it is likely to be necessary to notify the person to whom the complaint is directed towar ds in an effort Clinical Program Manual 25 25 to remedy the situation. 2. It is possible that additional people may be contacted in order to gather information pertaining to the complaint (e.g., if a complaint is about mentoring, bring in other students of the mentor to inquire about their experiences with the mentor). 3. The Grievance Committee should be used only when other points of contact for grievances have not yie lded a satisfactory resolution. A person may choose to go to the department chair rather than to the committee. 4. A grievance can be brought by one or more students or can be presented by a GSCC represen tative for a group of students. It is important to recognize that the names of students bringing the grievance will not be confidential as the accused person has the r ight to know who is lodging the complaint against them. F ormation of Grievance Committee 1. The Grievance Committee will consist of three faculty members (a chair plus two additional tenured faculty members) 2. The members of the Grievance Committee will not be permanent but rather will be selected for each individual case. 3. The selection of these committee members will be done in the following way: a. The student bringing the grievance will select one of the pr og ram directors to be the chair. It is ad he/she would have already tried to remedy the situation by contacting this individual. b. The selected chair will choose one tenured faculty member to serve on the committee. c. The stu dent will choose one tenured faculty member to serve on the committee. d. It is advisable that the selected chair and the student confer on their selections. Function of the committee 1. The committee will attempt to mediate the grievance and find a reso lution. 2. The committee can make recommendations to the D epartment C hair. The Department C hair does have the power to over - ride decisions made by the committee. Notes and Explanations 1. No student will be on the committee because it would put the student in a compromising situation to have to make decisions regarding faculty who may be their teacher or mentor. The ability of the student to choose two of the three committee members gives an enormous amount of power to the student bringing the griev ance, likely more so than having a student on the committee. 2. No non - tenured faculty will be able to be on the committee because it would put them in a compromising situation to have to make decisions that could impact their ability to receive tenure. Clinical Program Manual 26 26 3. Some aspects of the grievances are not confidential. If a student wishes to communicate a concern confidentially, there are numerous other mechanisms for doing so. The al is to work out a resolution. This requires both parties b e ing notified of the grievance. Confidentially would be maintained to any individuals outside those that must be notified in order to reach a resolution. More information can be found in the Graduate Handbook, the University Bulletin, and the GSCC page at ( see the link at the bottom of the page). Clinical Program Manual 27 27 PART III -- Coursework, Research, & Clinical Work COURSEWORK Permits and Registration Registration is done through myMemphis, available at You should have your student ID and your password. The password was assigned to you by the graduate admissions office when you applied. Your password was indicated in the last paragraph of the letter from graduate admissions acknowledging your application. If you have lost your password, call 678 - 2810 to have your password reset. Most graduate classes are listed under two nu mbers, one starting with a 7 (e.g., PSYC 7010) and one starting with an 8 (e.g., PSYC 8010). Often these appear together as, for example, PSYC course beginning for courses beginning with 8***. Where to get Class Permits and Help Registering for Classes The graduate secretary, Ms. Cynthia Walker, is the person who will help you with all of the various permits, forms, and registrations that you may need. She also keeps track of your records to know her! Many department and university forms can a lso be found at the website ( Registering for Courses Please register for all graduate courses at least one month before the semester begins otherwise low enrollment courses may be dropped by the University The graduate coordinator and DCT will send instructions on registration to new students before they arrive at the University of Memphis. We have streamlined the procedure. Most (not all) courses are open to Psychology Program Graduate students and no longer require Fo rm Bs or permits. However, we have added an important third step to the process . Please: 1. Consult with your Major Professor about your schedule. 2. Register online for courses. 3. Complete a Registration Notification Form online Again: Clinical Program Manual 28 28 All student s are required to enroll online after consulting with their major professor. Current students are required to enroll and complete the Registration Notification Form. If you add or drop a course , complete a revised Notification form. If for some reason you are unable to meet the deadline (that will be announced by the graduate directors each semester) please contact the graduate secretary: Cynthia Walker, Room 326, 678 - 4340. cywshngt@memphis.edu . PLEASE NOTE : Any student who does not enroll and complete the Notification form by the deadline runs the risk of being deleted from the course roll at the start of classes. Registration and Notification Notice after May 1 (for fall registration) require departmenta l approval to avoid deletion from courses.

Sometimes you can get the necessary permit by just asking the graduate secretary. Otherwise, you can contact the instructor in person or by email. Registering for Mileston e Credits and Independent Study Courses T here are quirky rules about registering for "milestones" such as thesis and dissertation. Once you enroll for these courses, you continue to do so until the project is completed. Each semester you would receive an IP (In Progress) until the work is compl eted; in the final semester your grade would be S (Satisfactory) or U (Unsatisfactory). Rule of thumb: Take the last of these hours only when you are not only sure you will defend the final project, but you will have time to submit the final project to t he Graduate School. There is an upper limit on how many hours you can accumulate toward a degree under different types of credit. You can earn up to 3 hours of credit for work on your thesis, up to 6 hours for your MAP, and up to 9 hours for work on your dissertation. If you wish to get course credit for doing research in a lab or for completing an independent research project other than a thesis or dissertation, or for doing work in a community agency that is unrelated to your graduate assistantship pl acement, you will need to fill out a "contract" with the professor who will be overseeing the work and assigning the grade. These "courses" are Clinical Program Manual 29 29 graded as S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory) akin to a Pass/Fail system. If the work is research - related, then it is considered Research Practicum (PSYC 7/8601 through 7/8609). If the work is more like an independent study or involves work in the community, then it is considered Special Problems (PSYC 7/8615). The "Special Problems and Research Practicum Cont ract" Registering for Classes while on Internship (see also Appendix G) Students who are on internship should register for PSYC 8999 ( Clinical and School Students). The internship courses are categorized as "EX" for externship with a designated grade of "NC" for non - credit. There are no fees associated with this course number . The rationale is to allow students to continue enrollment and also to continue deferment on student loans until graduation. You should also register for dissertation credits during the semester you plan to defend . GRADUATION At the beginning of the semester the student intends to graduate, he or she must submit a candidacy form to the G raduate School: - s.memphis.edu/gradschool/ Print out and complete this form, and then have it signed by your major professor . This form should then be turned in to the Chair's administrative assistant (Laura Simpson) , who will make a copy for the department's records and ensure that the form is submitted to the College of Arts and Sciences for the signature of the Director of Graduate Studies. You should have a checklist of which requirements you need to meet to earn your degree. The graduate catalog that was in force the year of your admission is the catalog that lists the requirements that apply to you. The intent to graduate, masters/doctoral degree candidacy, and cap and gown order forms should be turned into the Graduate School according to the schedule indicated on the website. The student should also turn in the defended and corrected thesis/dissertation copy to the office of the Graduate School for review according to the timeline listed on the website. The final electronic thesis/dissertation should be turned in to the Graduate School by a certain date. Be sure to check the graduate school web site for information regarding the layout of your t hesis/dissertation pages that will be handed in to the Graduate School. When it is time to get your degree you must turn in the appropriate paperwork to the Graduate School. Failure to turn in the appropriate forms and material to the Graduate School will result in the delay of graduation. Be sure to consult the graduate catalogue and pay attention to announcements from the Graduate Secretary so that you comply with all deadlines and procedures. Important note: You must be enrolled in at least one credit ho ur of thesis (PSYC 7996) or dissertation, (PSYC 9000) in order for the defense meeting, binding, and graduation to occur. MATERIALS TO THE GRADUATE SCHOOL BY THE GRADUATE Clinical Program Manual 30 30 G RADU ATE S TUDENT F ORMS General Information about Forms All forms are available online at: If you have departmental f orm(s) with all the required signatures, give them to the Graduate Programs Secretary (Cynthia Walker) , located in Room 326. If you need a signature from the Chair, leave the form in the appropriate tray in the main office. If you need signature from the Graduate Coordinator, leave the form in the mail box located in the mail/copy room. Once signed, the form will be given to the Graduate Programs Secretary. Signed Graduate School forms must be given to Laura Simpson in the main office. She will circul ate them through the appropriat e University channels . Selecting Courses Your coursework will include both required and elective courses relevant to your career objectives. For a complete list of required courses broken down by research areas see the Appendix. To review available course offerings, including meeting times and locations, visit . During the first year in graduate school, students enroll in a pretty regimented set of courses. As students progress they have more room for electives. We recommend that you meet with your major professor at the beginning of each term to discuss the courses for which you should register. What is a Full - Time Load? Students on assistantships must maintain enrollment in at least 9 credit hours for fall and for spring semesters. This is in part to ensure that you qualify to have the university cover your tuition and fees. A typical load wo uld be one, two, or three courses, each worth 3 or 4 hours of credit. Any other hours needed to make the 9 - hour cutoff would be filled with course s such as a course credit for working in a research lab (Research Practicum), or course credit for working on a thesis or dissertation.

The Graduate Programs Secretary has the necessary paperwork. The two - step process involves first asking the university to accept a certain number of hours of credit, and then asking the department to let you count one or two of those courses toward you might transfer some hours that will count toward the gran d total of hours need ed to get your degree, but they might not exempt you from specifi c program requirements. For example, you might have taken an interesting and high quality Psych course at another school, and the University of Memphis would likely accept those hours as gene ral transfer credits. out of a specific course requirement. The university will allow you to transfer up to 50 graduate credits towards your req uired total hours for the Ph.D. However, only 9 of these hours can be used as substitutions f or courses in a Ph.D. program. You must and t he depa See the Graduate Programs Secre tary for directions and forms. Department decisions about transfers are made by the Graduate Coordinator (Dr. Bob Cohen). Substitutions are not granted for any of the clinical program's core curriculu m . For transfer credit to count in the clinical program it must have been earned in an APA clinical doctoral program in psychology. Decisions about transfers are made by the clinical faculty to ensure that required content (e.g., regarding ethics, multicul tural issues) is adequately covered. Further information regarding graduate course transfers is available online at Grades Although you need to do well (earn Bs or As) in all your courses, from here on out your grades will be emphasized less relative to your research productivity, clinical skills, and professional skills set ( writing and quantitative ability, work ethic, colle giality). - earned will be counted toward degree requirements. If a C or lower is earned for a course that is considered part of the "clinical core," the course must be repeated and a grade of B or higher must be earned the next time around. In order to remain eligible for departmental funding, you must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 on a 4 - point scale. A minimum of 3.0 is also required for gra duation. Clinical Program Manual 34 34 degree but will be calculated in the GPA. Please note that g rades from other institutions are not computed in calculating the GPA. Academic Probation A g raduate student whose cumulative grade point average drops below 3.00 will be placed on probation. A second consecutive semester on probation can result in suspension . Conditions under which continuation in the Graduate School beyond two consecutive semest ers on probation will be granted must be recommended by the academic unit and approved by the director of graduate studies in the student's college and the Vice Provost for Graduate Programs. If, in the opinion of the director of graduate studies, the aca demic unit, and the Graduate School, a degree - seeking student is not making satisfactory progress toward degree completion, the student will be dismissed from the degree program. Appealing a Grade If you are uncertain about why you received a specific grad e, the first thing to do is to set up a time to speak with your professor for the course. You can then request a breakdown of the grade you received. If you meet with your professor and are still unsatisfied, you may formally appeal a grade by submitting t o the Department Chair a Graduate Grade Appeal Form (available online, in the Main Office or in the Graduate School Office). In addition to this form, you must ten rebuttal. You have 30 days from the end of the term in which the contested grade was received to submit these materials. The Chair has 15 days to address the complaint with you and the professor. If the department chair was the professor, or if the co mplaint cannot be successfully resolved within the above guidelines, then you have 5 days to request in writing, with a copy to the Graduate School, that the Chair forward the appeal to the Graduate School office for evaluation. For a detailed discussion or online at Academic Integrity The U The psychology department takes all matters involving academic dishonesty very seriously , and students are responsible for following proper guidelines. From a broader perspective, the Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association requires you to follow a number of ethical guidelines. These include your conduct in all spheres of profess ional functioning (research, academic, clinical, etc). One of your first courses will cover the APA Ethics Code , and sections of it will be explored again as you progress in your training . In addition , topics involving ethics are included i n our Clinical F orum meetings. A link to the APA Ethics Code can be found here: RESEARCH Clinical Program Manual 35 35 Institutional Review Board (IRB) All University of Memphis faculty, staff , and students who propose to engage in any research activity involving the use of human subjects including research for theses and dissertations must have prior approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is responsible for safeguarding rights and welfare of all persons participating in research projects, whether funded or non - funded. Psychological Service Center (PSC) - Research Review Board If you would like to conduct research in the PSC, you would need to get permission from the director of the PSC. Your project will need to go through another level of review in addition to the University's Institutional Review Board. The PSC version of the IRB is called the PSC Research Review Board. This review committee pays special attention to ethical and logistical considerations as they affect the clinic, its therapists and its clients. Contact the PSC Director, for more in formation about this process. Proposals and Final Defenses For each research milestone, there must always be a formal proposal meeting and a final defense meeting . Working in collaboration with your Major Professor , you will prepare a written document for each stage , and also identify a committee (3 - 4 other faculty members who will evaluate your work) . When the proposal or defense paper has been approved by your mentor (typically after several drafts), he/she will give you permission to send the milestone proposal or final paper to your committee. You must send the committee a final draft two full weeks before the meeting. Likewis e, it will often take your mentor ~ 2 weeks to turn around drafts. Also, when you are attempting to find a time to schedule the meeting, first generate a list of 4 - 5 times that would work for you and your mentor, and then email those times to the rest of your committee. Please do not email your committee and ask them to identify all of thei r free times during a given period . During the meeting you will present your study idea (proposal meeting) or results (defense meeting) typically in the form of a brie f power - point presentation. T he committee will then ask you questions about your research project. You are expected to be able to answer all questions about any studies you have cited and to fully understand and be able to explain your data analyses, and study limitations . The meeting is not simply a time for you to consult with your committee; y ou are expected to demonstrate mastery of the material and analyses. If you pass the meeting (meaning you successfully convinced your committee that your project has merit and you have mastery of the relevant literature/methods), there are several f orms that must be filled out, signed, and handed in upon the completion of each stage for each milestone ( conveniently summarized in Appendix F ) . There are deadlines fo r filing these each semester. The following page gives useful information: . The department also has a competency rating form that the graduate director will email to you when you announce your milestone meet ing via email. You must bring copies of the competency assessment form to your meeting. Each member of your committee must complete this form and turn it in to the graduate director to evaluate your competency. The proposal defense occurs at a committee meeting. Some committee c hairs prefer extensive i ntroduction sections, whereas others wish it to approximate a full - length journal article (in all cases it should include a substantive intro/review and discussion and should not resemble a Clinical Program Manual 36 36 brief report) . I t is best to work out methodological details and analytic issues during the proposal meeting. Committee members will not sign proposal acceptance forms if there are changes to the m ethods section until those changes have been clarified in a revised m ethods section. For all three milestones, there is a formal final defense stage including a formal committee meeting after each project has been completed and distributed to committee members. The final defense is devoted to clarifying and expanding upon issues from the research or review paper. The student is encouraged to speak with committee members individually prior to the final defense to help prepare for it. An annou ncement about the defense must be emailed to the faculty and graduate students several days before the defense. All defenses are public events. Thesis in close supervision with the major p rofessor. T he thesis must be empirical and it provides the studen t the opportunity to devise and implement his or her own research project and to begin to establish a course of research. Students develop ideas for their thesis in conjunction with their major professors in an a rea The thesis p roject gene rally results from reading and developing a thorough familiarity with a particul ar area of research literature. From the time they first enter training, students should be developing skills as question - asking researchers, and the thesis represen ts the empirical investigation of one such question. When you've defended your thesis, you may have completed the requirements for your M.S. degre e. The graduation reg ulations can be very confusing. The web site for up - to - date information is : mphis.edu/gradschool/current_students/graduation_information/graduation.php Publication as an Alternati ve to Thesis The faculty recognizes that some exceptional students may have developed their research to the extent that they are already contributing t o the professional literature. In such cases, the usual requirements of the thesis may not be the most effective means of furthering professional development. Students, therefore, have the option of satisfyin g the thesis requirement by submitting evidence of published s cholarly activity. Publication in psychology often involves a collaborative effort, making it difficult to gauge the substantive contribution of individual authors. Although collaborative endeavor is important in rese arch, t he major aim of the thesis is independent thinking and writing skills. Thus there are limited cases in which a publication could serve as a substitute for this research requirement . The student must be the fi rst author on the publication being presented. If there are oth er authors on the publication , the student must provide written statements from each of these coauthors indicating the extent of his or her contribution to the conception, execution, and writin g of the work. A student may submit a work that is in press. However, the student must provide appropriate documentation certifying that the material has been accepted for publication. The procedure for submitting publications to mee t the thesis requiremen t parallels the usual procedure for these requirements. The student must select a chairperson and committee to evaluate the published work. The rules concerning the size and composition of these committees depend on the requirement that the student wants t o satisfy and are the same as those outlined Clinical Program Manual 37 37 The student will have to defend his or her publication(s) at a formal committee meeting open to all interested persons to permit it to be substituted for the research requirement considered. The committee may vote to either acc ept the published work as an appropriate substitute or reject the work as inappropriate or insufficient to meet the requirement. The decision of the committee is based on a majority vote of the committee members. Mid - Point Project (also known as doctoral qualifying exams) The second milestone paper is known as the Mid - Point Project. Mid - Poin t Projects vary widely. There must be a separate proposal and defense meeting for all milestones (you cannot have a combined proposal and defense meeting). Note that the midpoint defense must b e completed (and passed) by May 31 of the year you intend to apply to internship. The following are acceptable types of Mid - Point Projects: 1. Traditional review paper . (MAP) review paper modeled after Psychological Bulletin papers . 2. Empirical manuscript, submitted to a journal . To meet the requirement for this milestone, the manuscript must be analysis, final write - up), wit h guidance from his/her mentor. For this o ption the work should be sufficiently distinct from their thesis project. 3. Submission of a grant with student as PI . For this option, the study idea and the written work comprising the grant proposal are the s The prototypic al grant submission would be a federally funded pre - doctoral fellowship (e.g., NIH F31 - point Project committee. Students may also opt to pursue applied research projects as follows: 4. Ap pl ied clinical research project: Clinical case study design . Students prepare and submit a scholarly manuscript based on their wor k as a therapist with a single, or small number of, client (s) . This work would be conducted in conjunction with the mentor and case supervisor. 5. Applied research project: Consultation . Students would prepare and submit a scholarly manuscript based on work conducted in collaboration with a community agency or other Dissertation For students entering with a he dissertation is usually completed i n the fifth year . Please note that this mi lestone must be proposed by 9/15 of the year in which the student plan s to apply for internship. Thus, all signed paperwork for the successfully defended pr oposal must be turned in by this date. For more information about the dissertation, see the Psychology Department Handbook. Although the deadline is 9/15 , we strongly advise you to propose your Clinical Program Manual 38 38 dissertation by August 1 of the year you apply to internship s o that you have ample time to devote to internship applications and so that you can complete your data collection before leaving for internship the following June/July. Committees and Mid - point committee s must have a minimum of 3 members, at least 1 of whom must be from outside the Clinical area. Each committee has a Chairperson (your major professor) responsible for the most detailed guidance of the project. Your advisor can help you in selecting the rest of your committee. The committee for the Dissertation 3 other members, at least 1 of whom must be from outside the Clinical area . Similarly, t he Dissertation committee consists of the Chair person and 3 other m embers. At least one member must be from another department or from outside the Clinical area. Before each committee meeting (e.g., thesis proposal, dissertation final defense) you must send your final draft of the paper to your committee 2 weeks in adva n ce of the meeting date. This is to give your com mittee time to read your paper. In addition, you are expected to send an email announcement of the upcoming meeting to the faculty and students, so that they can attend the defense if they want. Progress through the Program Students should negotiate their planned deadlines with their Major Professor as early as possible in their graduate career and discuss their plan at least annually to see whether any changes should be made . Depending on whether or not y the program usually takes 4 or 5 years in residence, plus a one - year internship (5 6 years total) . Some students who enter with a bachelors are able to complete the program (including internship) in five years but this is rare because it is difficult to obtain the clinical and research skills required to be a competitive internship applicant by the end of your third year (the time when you begin the in ternship application process). T here are slightly lower internship match rates for students who apply in their 4 th versus 5 th year in training. Nevertheless, there have been some highly motivated students who have been able to successfully do this and if that is your plan talk to your advisor. Of course there are many factors that will be beyond your control, including the availability of clinical experiences to accrue hours during training, IRB and partici pant recruitment delays, etc . , so you can never count on completing in 4 years even with good planning and motivation. If you are ahead of schedule with your milestones, p erhaps the ideal plan is to apply for internship in your fifth year, and to have defended your dissertation (or at least collected all data) before the November 1 application deadline. This would make you an exceptionally competitive applicant (internships prefer candidates who have made substantial dissertation progress) and allow you to fully take advantage of the training opportunities available on internship without having to worry a bout working on your dissertation from afar. It will also save you an expensive trip back to Memphis to defend during your internship year. Most importantly, it will save you from becom but dissertation come back to Memphis to c omplete the dissertation before applying for postdoc. You should aim to complete the program in five years total (four years on campus). You are required to complete 3 year s of clinical training, and you cann ot begin those clinical experiences until you r second year (after completing our core clinical Clinical Program Manual 39 39 classes in your first year ) . A good timeline for students entering with their masters is to complete your second milestone project by the end of your second yea r in the program and then complete your dissertation in year 3 so that you can apply to internship in the fall of your 4 th year with a dissertation defended (or at least data collection completed). An important note about progress . As faculty members o ur most important task is to uphold the scientific integrity of the research that is conducted under our watch and the integrity of the Ph.D. degree. For this reason, although we want to help you to make rapid progress, we cannot sacrifice the integrity/q progress. For example, i t is not approp riate to propose a simple and quick dissertation simply becau se of a desire to meet a deadline . A dissertation should be a major scientific project that contributes to the literature (this is true even if you desire a clinical career) . We encourage you to plan ahead and strive to make rapid milestone progress but also to keep in mind that t here are events beyond your control (data collection or IRB holdups, computer crashes, etc.) that can stall progress . M any students also struggle to write quickly and effectively. As previously noted, m entors will typically require about 2 weeks to turn around drafts (not including breaks/holidays), but this assum es a reasonable quality of writing and appropriate analyses. Please do not expect that mentors will be able to turn drafts around in few days to meet your deadline, or that a committee will be able to meet without having your draft a full two weeks in adv ance (although this is sometimes possible, it cannot be assumed) . Also keep in mind that most faculty members do not get paid over the summer and may have limited availability to edit your milestone drafts or manuscripts . A note about the use of archival data for milestones. Many students are able to complete milestone projects using archival data, but this is not always possible, and it is ideal for all students to have the experience of designing an original data collection project from scratch (generating the idea, writing the IRB, collecting data etc.) at least once during your graduate career. In particular, the dissertation is often expected to be a fairly independent and substantive project that will often entail new data collection and po ssibly an experimental or longitudinal design (keep in mind you will be talking about your dissertation during all of your internship, postdoc, and job interviews) . Suggested deadlines for U of M clinical program milestones (this will vary depending a n umerous factors - there is no one size fits all approach) Possible 5 - Year Plan Fall Spring S ummer Year 1 Get acclimated to lab , research literature Develop thesis idea Write thesis IRB and proposal drafts Year 2 Thesis proposal by 12/1 Present in Clinical Forum Finalize thesis IRB, begin data collection Continue data collection Year 3 - external placement Complete data collection; Thesis defense by 12/1 Propose MPP by 4/1 Complete MPP Project Clinical Program Manual 40 40 Year 4 - applying for internship by December Defend MPP by 9/1 Disse rtation proposal by 12/1 College dissertation data Collect dissertation data , prepare for internship applications (write essays, prep site list, determine letter writters) Year 5 Internship applications due 11/1; Defend Dissertation by 12 /1; internship interviews begin after 12/1 Internship interviews Begin internship (typically July1) Year 6 Internship Possible 4 Year Plan Fall Spring S ummer Year 1 Get acclimated to lab, research literature Develop thesis idea Write thesis IRB and proposal drafts Year 2 Thesis proposal by 10 /1 Present in Clinical Forum Collect thesis data Collect thesis data Year 3 - external placement Thesis defense by 9/30 Propose MPP by 1 1 /30 Defend MPP by 5 /3 1 prepare for internship applications (write essays, prep site list, determine letter wri ters) Year 4 - applying for internship by December Propose dissertation by 9/15, complete internship applications by 11/1, interviews begin 12/1 internship interviews; dissertation data collection Present to Clinical Forum Dissertation data collection, begin internship (typically July 1) Year 5 Internship Complete dissertation *** Note: To apply for internship, students must defend their Mid - point Project by May 31st and then defend their dissertation pro posal by September 15th . * ** Clinical Program Manual 41 41 Transferring a Thesis Some students have already completed a thesis in psychology when they enter our program. In this case, the thesis must be evaluated by m embers of our program to determine whether the work meets standa rds for a thesis produced here. If not, you may n eed to complete another thesis. The thesis must be empirical in nature and approved by a three - person committee, headed by your mentor . Members hip on the committee should follow the regul ar rules for thesis committees. The committee will review the completed thesis and accept or reject it. The committee need not meet or schedule an oral defense bu t may do either at the option of any committee mem ber. If a majority of the committee approves, the thesis requirement will be waived. If this situation applies to you, please consult with the DCT for additional information about paperwork. Attending Conferences Almost all of our students present their work at professional co nferences all over the world. Be prepared, as you make progress on your research, to submit abstracts for consid eration by various conferences. Often w hole labs will travel together. These are wonderful opportunities not only to pres ent your work, but also to forge important connections with other professionals in your field. Of course, attendin g conferences can be expensive. Please apply for travel support through the graduate school and the department: Many conferences also have (competitive) student travel awards. CLINICAL WORK C linical S upervisor s Beginning in the second year, students register for 3 hours of clinical training (7/8438) for a minimum of six semesters in our Psychological Services Center. Each student submits rankings for clinical supervisors, which are assigned on the basis of student preferences, clinical training needs , and class limits. Supervisors are assigned for a one - year period. Learning to be a Therapist There are three main ways that students receive training in providing psychotherapy. First, all clinical students are required to take Introduction to Psychothe rapy as well as two additional psychotherapy courses taught by different instructors. (Students in the Psychotherapy Research Area are required to take a third psychotherapy course.) The second aspect of training in psychotherapy skills is the practice of psychotherapy itself in our PSC under the close supervision of the faculty . Departmental supervisors represent a broad range of expertise in and orientations toward psychotherapy, but all endorse empirically - supported t reatments (EST s). Third, all students are required to complete 20 hours of paid clinical placement (could be divided into two 10 - h o u r segments over two years). This could take place in the PSC, in an external placement, or working as a therapist on a clinical research study . Fourth, many students complete volunteer practica, and also obtain clinical hours in their lab. Finally, Dr. Neil Aronov Clinical Program Manual 42 42 offers a weekly Skills Lab that provides students with the opportunity to practice psychotherapy skills. Please email Neil for more information: neil_aronov@hotmail.com Psychotherapy Videos : as noted above, the library includes an extensive catalog of psychotherapy videos that can be accessed remotely. You can use this to get an illust ration of a new type of therapy or as a way to brush up on a technique prior to a therapy session: Students also develop their clinical skil ls by attending workshops and professional conferences (such as ABCT and APA). Tracking Your Clinical Hours Please record all of your clinical hours using My Psych Track: This trac king site is free to all APPIC programs and you can call 617 - 612 - 2866 for help. Accumulating clinical hours and assessment experience . St udents generally accrue ~800 direct contact (assessment plus therapy) clinical hours during their time in our program. Some students begin accruing hours in their research lab as a first year if their lab is conducting research on clinical populations (this included undergraduates o r other individuals who have been selected on the basis of a clinical symptom such as problem gambling or post - traumatic stress symptoms). You will begin accruing more hours at the start of your second year when you begin to see clients in the PSC. Pleas e keep in mind that if often takes a full semester to build a regular case load of 2 - sense that you are behind in hours you can make an effort to carry a bigger caseload in the PSC, do more clinically - relevant work in your lab, complete an extra volunteer practica, or request an additional clinical placement in your 4 th or even 5 th year. You can accrue hours that count towards your internship application until No vember of the year you apply to internship. Please keep in mind that hours are not the most important element of your application . It is much more important to strive for high quality in your work, mastery of some evidence based treatment approaches, and t o earn strong reviews from supervisors. That begin said, do plan to maintain a steady accumulation of hours and keep in mind that there will be ebbs and flows in our PSC client flow, so be willing to pick up extra clients when they are available . Finally, be sure to begin every PSC intake with a comprehensive assessment, and ask for opportunities to complete psycho - educational assessments in the PSC as well (and try to complete several during your time in our program) . T he P sychological S ervices C enter (PSC) You are generally expected to accrue a total of 50 hours of client contact time each year . Client contact includes both assessment and therapy hours for individual clients of all ages and for couples and families. Deficient hours can be made up in th e summer for the preceding year, but weekly with your faculty supervisor to learn assessment and therapy methods, to review your cases , and to plan the therapy you prov ide your clients. Both individual and group meetings will be used for psychotherapy instruction. The pedagogical aim of clinical training in the PSC is to facilitate the development of the fundamental skills necessary to conduct successful assessment and p sychotherapy, including but not limited to interpersonal skills, clinical judgment skills, rapport building and facility using Clinical Program Manual 43 43 specific psychotherapeutic techniques. The goal of clinical practicum training is to bring you from being informed of clinical is sues in a theoretical sense toward the implementation of skills for intervention with individuals, families, and groups. ** * For a comprehensive manual detailing all aspects of clinical training in the *** Clinical Placements (paid assistantships) and Practic a (volunteer experiences) All clinical students are required to spend at least one year on a clinical placement such as the PSC, one of our clinical research grants, or an extern al clinical placement ( this could be 20 hours in one year or ten hours across two years ). These applied experiences are developed and maintained by the Director of Clinical Training and a re typically funded positions. Most often, students complete this placement during the ir third and or fourth year. Many students also arrange volunteer training experiences (i.e., practica ) at local organizations. Students who wish to do a practicum should understand that these opportunities change frequently and the D CT frequently send out emails with available practica. New p ractica require the permission of your Major Professor and the DCT. Permission is granted for one semester and must be renewed if you continue for a second semester. We ask this in order to preve nt one student from staying in a practicum indefinitely and essentially denying other students that opportunity. Please see Appendix C for the Clinical Practicum Contract required to obtain a practicum. The VAMC offers excellent unpaid training (across a variety of their specialty clinics) , as does the Exchange Club, LeBonheur Pediatric Neuropsychology, and Semmes - Murphy Neurology Clinic. Varangon Academy (youth training facility) offers a paid practica . At times Dr. Aronov also offers a paid assessment p ractica at times . The DCT will email all students when practica opportunities become available. Selecting a Clinical Placement (see Appendix C for placement options) Each s pring, the Director of Clinical Training asks students to rank their preferences for clinical placements . The placement assignments are made by a committee of faculty m embers, one of whom is the DCT. This committee assigns students to placements according to a complicated system by early summer. Placements generally run from September 1 - August 31. Internship Also in accordance with APA requirements, all clinical students must complete a one - year, full - time clinical internship. Our s tudents typically complete the internship in the fifth or sixth year after entering the program. Individual internships vary considerably in their focus, and although all internships are clinical in nature, some sites more heavily emphasize research than o thers. Our students enroll in a Professional Issues course (1 hr.) designed to help them prepare for internship applications during the fall before they apply for internship . L ed by our DCT and Dr. Marcks , the course helps students write the required ess ay s and prepare for interviews. Once students know which internships they would like to apply to, they must submit their list to the clinical faculty for approval. Students may not apply to internships that are not approved for them. Clinical Program Manual 44 44 Our program requires t hat students apply to APA accredited sites f or the first round of matching. If they do not achieve a match, the student may apply to any APPIC program that has an available position . Students receive considerable help in this process, and not matching is a n extremely rare phenomenon. The APPIC website ( ) is an invaluable resource for exploring internship opportunities. In addition, the DCT will give you a form useful for tracking your clinical hours. How to Know When to Apply for Internship First, you can only apply for internship when you have comp leted the necessary milestones. The final Mid - Point Project defense must be completed b y 5 /31 and the Dissertation proposal must be defended successfully by 9/15 of the year in which students plan to apply for internship . Second, students must be cleared by the clinical faculty in the May/ June evaluation meeting for permission to apply for internship during the following fall . Before this meeting, students should discuss their desire to apply for internship with their M ajor P rofessor and provide evidence that they are ready to attend. We ask that they provide information on their number of hours of psychotherapy and assessment, as well as their number of hours of s upervision. In addition, it is helpful to have the estimated hourly totals at the time they will need to complete in ternship application materials. Students should also review the CUDCP Minimum Requirements for Internship Eligibility. In addition, students should talk with their M ajor P rofessors about the types of internship progra ms to which they want to apply. Major P rofessors are responsible for presenting this information on their students. request to apply for internship. There will be another faculty meeting in late September or early October meeting where the faculty give final approval for candidates to apply to internship and also approve (and most importantly provide feedback/suggesti ons on) your site list (see below) . Our program is designed so that students will have no difficulty accumulat ing ~ 800 direc t client contact hours . The median number of direct contact (assessment plus intervention) hours nationwide is approximately 800, but keep in mind that the quality of your work, as reflected in your letters of recommendation and your ability to talk (in interviews) and write (in essays) about your clinical work in a sophisticated manner that makes reference to available literature, is much more important that total hours. You should be aware there is wide variability among our students in terms of the types and amounts of experience they have attained by the time they apply for internship. There is no "magic number" of hours . Instead of focusing solely on your number of hours, y ou should aim to accumula te meaningful and worthwhile training that is consistent with your career goals . Selecting your Internship Sites for Application , Approval of Site Lists You will enroll in 8707, Professional Issues, during the fall and spring of the year that you are applying for internship. One of the first tasks you will complete is the selection of internship programs to apply to. It is required that you apply to internship programs that are APA accredited. Further, you will be encouraged to maximize your chances for success by applying to a range of programs (low, moderate, and high competitiveness), including some programs that have taken our students below. After you have finalized your list, it must be approved by the clinical faculty as a whole. We do this to be sure you are applying to a range of sites (typically 12 or more) that are consistent with your experiences and give you a reasonable chance of matching. Because our Clinical Program Manual 45 45 program is that you are ready to apply to internship and are applying to a range of APA accredited sites that are a good fit for your experiences and our training model. For exa mple, if you are an adult focused student we would be unlikely to approve a site list that included predominantly child - focused internships. Please note : We do not ask clinical students not to apply to any given site. However, we do look at the balance o f the list of sites and ask that it meet the specifications above. Learning More a bout Internships Each s pring the DCT and students who are departing for internships have a symposium (during Clinical Forum) on the lessons learned during the application pro cess. We also have a series of meetings with students who are planning to apply the following year. Finally, we interviews and matches at internship sites across th e country. You can also find all kinds of relevant information at the website for the organization that oversees formal internship and post - doc programs, APPIC ( CONCLUSIONS or even if chances are that you are feeling a bit overwhelmed by all you will need to accomplish while you are here. meaning that you want to think in terms of a 4 - or 5 - year plan but r f these milestones all at once! We hope this manual will be helpful to you when you need a quick reference about the clinical program. If you have suggestions for the next revision of the manua l, we would love to hear your ideas.

Individuals at this level le0arn general principles, specific techniques to use, and see how that can flexibly be applied. Students at this fundamental level do not yet recognize patterns, and do not differentiate well between important and u nimportant details; they do not have filled - in cognitive maps of how, for example, a given patient may move from where he/she is to a place of better functioning. Intermediate Those at the intermediate level of competence have the knowledge, skills, and e xperience needed to recognize some important recurring situational components. They possess a foundation in assessment and intervention. Generalization of diagnostic and intervention skills to new situations and patients is limited, and support is needed to guide performance. They have the ability to execute assessment and treatment plans. They also have the maturity to critique themselves as well as skills to effectively utilize supervision and consultation. Advanced At this level, the individual can see his or her actions in terms of long - range goals or plans of which he or she is consciously aware. For the trainee at this level of competence, a plan establishes a perspective, and the plan is based on considerable conscious, abstract, analytic contemplati on of the problem (including review of scholarly/research literature as needed). The conscious, deliberate planning that is characteristic of this skill level helps achieve efficiency and organization. At this level, the trainee is less flexible in these a reas than the proficient psychologist, but does have a feeling of mastery and the ability to cope with and manage many contingencies of clinical work. Recognition of overall patterns, of a set of possible diagnoses and/or treatment processes and outcomes f or a given case, are taking shape. 48 Please note If a particular skill or knowledge is not observed then please note this in the column with the words N/O. unacceptably slow, the news improvement column should be checked. . 49 _______________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ ____________ Student Signature Supervisor Signature Rating of skill/knowledge level Self - Rating December June Needs improvement Relationship/Interpersonal Skills With client Ability to take a respectful professional approach with clients while maintaining professional boundaries.

Identify those goals here. These may be defined collaboratively in discussion between student and advisor. The signatures below indicate that the student has reviewed this form, and the student and adviser(s) have discussed it verbally. Signatures do not necessarily imply consen sus agreement on competencies . __________________________ ____________________________________________ Student Rater(s) Date Effective Research Styles How to develop them There are characteristics that are more prevalent in successful researcher s than unsuccessful researchers. Developing an effective research style is as important as learning the skills and content 1. Self - starter : More successful researchers create opportunit ies rather than wait for them to occur How? lots of ideas will surely produce a couple of good ones. Suggest new projects or jump on ideas that sound interesting. Ask for opportunities from peo 2. Action - orientation : More successful researchers get things done, they do not just think about getting things done How? Set goals that are clear, concrete, achievable, and bite - sized . It is hard to get started on a - do lists for the day and week and critique them to ensure that each activity is serving long - term goals, not just short - term even if only a few sentences. Many find it useful to start the day by writing an hour before other demands distract them. 66 3. Persistent : Research progress is slow and rejection is frequent. More successful academics will find reinforcers in the research process and learn from rejections, improve, and keep on going. How? Be involved in lots of projects - some will move more quickly than others just based on the success of the data collections, and pace of research process. Build - in lots of mini - rewards along the way. Celebrate goal - completions, submissions, good scores, and other positive events along the way. The markers of project progress can be reinforcers. Give one self the space to be pissed off or hurt when something is rejected, but don't wallow in it. Instead of waiting weeks or months to pick up something that has some critical feedback, give yourself days or hours to have the emotional reaction and then dive ba ck in. Avoidance is a killer. 4. Works hard : In hard occupations, hard work increases the probability of success How? This one is just the simple reality. Research is hard, and those that put more time in will develop more skills, have more knowledge, and get more done. That will make them more competitive for the better jobs and enhance their overall impact. Calibrate how much the academic life will be "life." It can be a job, vocation, or calling. 5. Has a plan : More successful researchers have a plan fo r their research program - they set goals and track progress to guide near and long term efforts How? Write out goals - for week, month, year, 5 years. Check - in on those goals and revise them regularly - post them on your wall. Ensure that daily activitie s are serving those goals, and minimize activities that are irrelevant to your goals. 6. Problem - solver: More successful researchers are resourceful when confronted by conceptual or practical barriers to progress How? Step back from the details of the problem and consider the big picture of what you are trying to accomplish. Recognize that planning and preparation are sometimes among the biggest parts of a project. Start at the goal and work backwards to figure out ho w to get there. Identify the key barriers to achieving the goal and consider multiple solutions to achieve it. Use your estimates of feasibility, practicality, likelihood of success to inform selection of options. 67 APPENDIX B: SAMPLE CV DESIGNING YO UR CURRICULUM VITAE 68 Ace A. Student , M.S.

De scription: The Center for Population Sciences currently conducts three large scale research projects in conjunction with the United States Air Force. These projects include three broad areas, including weight loss, smoking cessation, and the reduction of problematic alcohol use. Each of these studies have involved intervention and study protocol development, and are now at the stage of monitoring ongoing interventions and study procedures, including fidelity and efficacy assessment. All of the intervention s are conducted at Air Force Technical Training bases located throughout the country. These placements involve only research skills, as none of these interventions are conducted in the Memphis area. The UTHSC - CPS faculty have also been involved in numerous completed research studies outside of the Air Force, which provide other opportunities for manuscript writing. In addition, there are several pending grants that would be conducted in the Memphis area, which may begin early as the fall of 2015. Students are matched with a faculty supervisor based on research interest and specific skills. Students will gain experience directly related to the research project and mentor they were 86 matched with; therefore, each research experience will be study - specific. Opp ortunities are available to work with more than one research mentor on various projects, depending upon interests and logistics. Depending upon the placement match, progress of the ongoing study, and student experience and ability, students will gain exper ience with problem - solving alternative study design (e.g., how to conduct research in the United States Air Force), conducting intervention fidelity ratings (content and motivational interviewing strategies), assessment measure development, manuscript writ ing, grant writing, and preparation of data for presentation and/or publication. It is our goal to offer a wide range of experiences and to have students feel that they are an active voice and contributing member of the research team. 4.
