MemphiSTEP : A STEM Talent Expansion Program at the University of Memphis Project Goals Students entering (or considering) STEM majors are invited to take part in a refresher course designed to boost pre-calculus skills, facilitate social networking and broaden knowledge of career opportunities in STEM fields. Annual Math Bootcamp NSF Grant Number: DUE 0756738 Project Strategies and Implementation Learning Communities . Learning communities are offered to incoming STEM freshmen. The learning communities use clusters of courses, often including math courses, to connect different disciplines to a common theme and to provide a collaborative learning experience. To increase the number of baccalaureate graduates in STEM at the U of M from 225 (2008) to not less than 335 (2013) through improvements in recruiting and retention. The project implements the following core strategies designed to increase graduation rates. Project Data 1. Impact on Graduation Numbers at the U of M For the 5 main years of the project (2008-09 through 2012-13), the number of students graduating in STEM from the U of M closely aligned with the projected benchmarks. Table 1 shows the actual and projected graduation numbers. Table 1: STEM degrees awarded in years 1 through 5 (Baccalaureate) 2. Retention in STEM for First-time, Fulltime Freshmen at the U of M We investigated retention rates of first-time, fulltime U of M STEM freshmen before and after the onset of the MemphiSTEP grant. Table 2 suggests that one, two, three and four year retention/ graduation rates in STEM increased since the onset of the MemphiSTEP program.

Retention and Performance of MemphiSTEP Students The retention and performance (GPA) of MemphiSTEP students is compared to that of a weighted control group of non- MemphiSTEP students. This control group is matched to the MemphiSTEP students in terms of demographics, major, class standing, and prior performance. The comparative analyses indicated that students who participated in MemphiSTEP activities were more likely to be retained in STEM and attain higher GPAs than non-project students enrolled in STEM during the project period (see Table 3).

The project (1) concentrates on all stages of a STEM student’s undergraduate experience – from first semester through graduation, (2) combines the strengths of the University’s support infrastructure with efforts and expertise of faculty, staff, students, administrators, and the professional community, and (3) builds on research, best practices, and the local knowledge base. It has been well-established that the lack of a solid preparation in mathematics often can be a deterrent to a student’s success in a STEM major. Although we concentrate on all STEM areas across the campus and each year of a student’s undergraduate career, mathematics , especially as used in science and engineering is a focal point of our key strategies and activities, especially for the early undergraduate years. Networking Program Any opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed on this poster are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the NSF. STEM students participate in a range of activities designed to facilitate networking among STEM majors at the U of M. Approximately ten large group events are arranged per academic year (e.g., lunch and learn sessions, motivational talks and science demonstrations) to encourage collaboration among students from all STEM disciplines. Undergraduate Research Program Patterned after NSF’s cross-divisional UBM (DMS/BIO/DUE) and CSUMS (DMS/DUE) programs, opportunities are available to STEM majors (primarily Juniors and Seniors) to participate in paid research fellowships. The goal is to offer students a chance to work with a professor in their selected area of study, and to gain valuable research experience. The research experience, designed to cover at least two semesters, aims to help students acquire knowledge and skills for graduate school, and skills for STEM-based careers . STEM Club Mini-Grant Program Ten mini-grants in the amount of $400 per year are available to U of M student organizations submitting proposals designed to: increase participation in STEM club activities, enhance professional development/career exploration in STEM majors, and increase opportunities for service leaning and outreach within STEM fields. Travel Award Program Travel awards of up to $400 are available to support student travel to conferences or STEM networking functions.
