Dr. Bailey’s initial responsibilities will include selecting associate editors and an editorial board that will work with him in providing high-quality contributions to research, practice, and education. “Dr. Bailey’s appointment as editor of this journal exemplifies his high regard within the accounting academic community and illustrates the quality of talent in the Fogelman College,” said Dr. Kenton Walker, director of the School of Accountancy. “Serving as editor of a journal published by the American Accounting Association carries the confidence of the AAA leadership in his ability to launch this new publication outlet.” The Journal of Forensic Accounting Research will concentrate on material related to forensic and investigative accounting, areas in which there has been a marked increase in interest. “Having another editorship at the University of Memphis will add to our growing reputation for scholarly leadership,” said Dr. Bailey. “My previous experience as associate editor for another AAA journal, Issues in Accounting Education , will be advantageous.” The AAA is an association of academic accountants with a highly international membership.
