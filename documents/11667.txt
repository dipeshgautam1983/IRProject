The habits of self-discipline and personal commitment that are required to gain and maintain a high level of physical fitness are inherent to the Marine Corps way of life and must be a part of the character of every Marine.

Doing so provi des greater health benefits and results in higher le vels of overall physical fitness.

Effective CCPs achieve the following: (1) Contribute to the overall health a nd wellness of every Marine through regular exercise, proper nutrition, health education and periodic physical and combat fitness evaluations. (2) Develop Marines who are physically cap able of performing their job requirements in garrison, training and combat. (3) Develop a reserve level of physical fitness and endurance in all Marines in order to enhance their survivability in a combat environment.
