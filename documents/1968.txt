Crews Center for Entrepreneurship Tools Entrepreneur Training Entrepreneur Fellows Program Home Crews Center Entrepreneur Training Find Your Edge Specialized training and workshops can help power thinkers, like yourself, become stronger and more seasoned entrepreneurs. Check in with us to see what's on the Crews upcoming calendar that can help you sharpen your business edge. Previous training opportunities have included: Elevator Pitch Workshop Picture this: You're on an elevator when suddenly an investor walks in that you have wanted to land a meeting with for months. You only have about 30 seconds to a couple of minutes to succinctly tell her/him about your idea. Commonly known as the elevator pitch. In this workshop, you will learn how to be compelling with your pitch, tailor it to different audiences and how to convert the elevator chat into a real meeting. Participants will develop a rough elevator pitch during the session and receive constructive feedback. Elevator pitches can be used in many different contexts, including pitching yourself, a startup idea, a school project, etc. Business Model Workshop In this workshop, you'll learn how to quickly develop a basic business model around your idea. We use the widely-known Business Model Canvas as a tool to understand the big picture view of your business. From that, you can form some assumptions and hypotheses about your customers, which leads to the process of customer development. If you have an idea and don't know what to do next to move it forward, this is workshop is for you! This is one of the first things we teach in our office hours sessions. Customer Development Workshop So you've used the Business Model canvas to create a business model, now what? In this workshop, you'll learn how to: Validate your business model through customer development Use an iterative approach to develop your product "Fail fast" and why this is a good thing Build a product that people actually want Prove that people want what you're building Upcoming Events &gt;&gt; See what’s happening News &gt;&gt; Success stories Contact Us &gt;&gt; Call or email Find Out More &gt;&gt; Get connected Full sitemap Admissions Prospective Students Undergraduate Graduate Law School International Parents Scholarship &amp; Financial Aid Tuition &amp; Fee Payment FAQs About UofM Academics Provost's Office Libraries Transcripts Undergraduate Catalog Graduate Catalog Academic Calendar Course Schedule Financial Aid Graduation Honors Program eCourseware Athletics Gotigersgo.com Ticket Information Intramural Sports Recreation Center Athletic Academic Support Recruits Former Tigers Facilities Tiger Scholarship Fund Media Research Sponsored Programs Research Resources Centers &amp; Institutes Chairs of Excellence FedEx Institute of Technology Libraries Grants Accounting Environmental Health Office of Institutional Research Support UofM Make a Gift Alumni Association Year of Service Administrative Support President's Office Academic Affairs Business &amp; Finance Career Opportunities Conference &amp; Event Services Development Office Government Relations Information Technology Services Media and Marketing Student Affairs Follow UofM Online Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Pinterest LinkedIn Text Only Print Got a Question?
