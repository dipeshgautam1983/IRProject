Office of the President About Mission and Plan Communications Leadership Contact Communications from the President's Office President's Report Home Office of the President Communications May 2015 Commencement Dear Campus Community: One of the most important events in the lives of our students is attendance at their graduation ceremony. We are pleased to announce that over 1,700 students participated in the commencement exercises on Sunday, May 10, 2015, where their degrees were conferred. Additionally, it is estimated that over 30,000 family and friends attended the two ceremonies in the FedEx Forum – the largest participation in recent history. Unfortunately not all of the family and friends of our students are able to be physically present for this very important experience in their student's lives. The University of Memphis recognizes the challenges that the family and friends of our graduates face, so we live stream the entire ceremony from the Forum to the internet so that it can be watched remotely. During last Sunday's events, there were 1,589 viewings of the two ceremonies from locations across the U.S. and from 84 different countries around the globe. We are proud to be able to offer multiple ways for families and friends to join in the celebration of this very important day in the life of our students. Please join me in congratulating all of our graduates. Go Tigers! M.
