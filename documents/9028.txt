Fogelman College of Business &amp; Economics About Programs Students Departments Faculty &amp; Staff Research News News News Current News News Archive Events College Publications Fogelman Focus Fogelman Flash Memo: Memphis Fogelman Features Department Newsletters Home FCBE News Dr. Jamin Speer to be Published in Journal of Human Resources and the Journal of Labor Economics Dr. Jamin Speer to be Published in Journal of Human Resources and the Journal of Labor Economics Dr. Jamin D. Speer, assistant professor of economics at the Fogelman College, recently had a paper accepted to be published in the Journal of Human Resources . The paper is entitled "Pre-Market Skills, Occupational Choice, and Career Progression." The paper used a combination of data sources to study the effects of workers' pre-market skills in various fields on their initial occupation choices and career progression patterns, with a particular focus on understanding gender gaps in occupation. The paper showed that pre-market skills, as measured by test scores and personality traits, accounted for a significant portion of occupational gender gaps, including 71 percent of the gender gap in science and engineering occupations. It also found that career trajectories were remarkably similar across workers, meaning that initial differences in occupation persist over time and that pre-market skills have long-lasting impacts on careers. Dr. Jamin D. Speer, assistant professor of economics at the Fogelman College of Business and Economics, accepted to be published in the Journal of Human Resources. Additionally, earlier this year Dr. Speer had another paper accepted for publication by the Journal of Labor Economics . The paper was titled, "Cashier or Consultant? Entry Labor Market Conditions, Field of Study, and Career Success." The article was co-authored with Yale University professors, Drs. Joseph Altonji and Lisa B. Kahn. This paper analyzed early labor market outcomes of U.S. college graduates as a function of their college major and economic conditions at the time of their graduation. The key finding was that graduating into a recession is harmful to early-career earnings. It is much less harmful for high-earning majors like economics. High-earning majors are more "recession-proof" than lower-earning majors, as the pay gap between high-earning majors and low-earning majors widens when the economy is in recession. This paper was also used as the subject of a New York Times article that discussed the returns of graduating in certain academic disciplines in a recessionary economy. "The Journal of Human Resources and the Journal of Labor Economics are two preeminent journals in labor economics. Publishing in either journal alone would be a major accomplishment. However, Jamin has now had papers accepted in both publications within his first two semesters here at Fogelman College," said Dr. Bill Smith, chair of the Department of Economics. "Jamin is off to a great start and we are extremely proud of him."
