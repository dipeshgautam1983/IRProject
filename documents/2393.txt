From field to fabric, to manual classing and the use of HVI data, through risk management and the basics of price protection - the program offers an in-depth look at cotton from virtually every perspective. Dramatic changes in cotton's production, processing, classification, transportation, and manufacturing technologies; and the continuing evolution of new trade patterns brought about by the expansion of free trade in cotton in South and Central America, Eastern Europe, and Central and Southeast Asia require expanded educational programs for those involved in all facets of the cotton industry in both the producing and consuming nations of the world. The 2016 International Cotton Institute will be held at the Fogelman Executive Conference Center and Hotel on the grounds of the University of Memphis. When not attending lectures or classing cotton, participants can retreat to the fourth floor commons area. The hotel commons area is complete with fireplace, board games and television, and kitchen. Each guest room is equipped with a private bath, queen-sized bed, 19&rdquo; television with remote, work desk with modem ports, and private balcony.
