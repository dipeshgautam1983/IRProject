Department of Theatre &amp; Dance About Academic Programs Admissions People Production Archives Home Theatre &amp; Dance Archives Arcadia Arcadia by Tom Stoppard November 4, 6, 9 and 12, 2011 7:30 pm (Studio Rep) PHOTOS Romance and mystery meet in an award-winning comedy about landscape architecture, mathematics, and Lord Byron. Events from 1809 and today overlap as two modern-day scholars attempt to unravel history at an English manor home. Both worlds collide as the quests for knowledge and passion run their courses, and everyone is forced to confront the reality of the attraction Newton left out. "It's the best possible time to be alive, when everything you thought you knew is wrong," writes Tom Stoppard in what The Independent called the "greatest play of our age." Join us opening night for a discussion about themes pertaining to the play and a reception before the show. 6pm in the CFA lobby.
