UofM Lambuth Will Open Center for Community Criminology Research October 30, 2015 - The Center for Community Criminology Research (CCCR) at the University of Memphis Lambuth will open with a ribbon cutting Monday, Nov. 9, at 2 p.m. in the Wisdom Parlor in Varnell-Jones Hall. The CCCR's mission is to serve as a resource for the community by addressing issues of crime and delinquency, according to Dr. K.B. Turner , chair of Criminology and Criminal Justice. The Center will serve as a clearinghouse for the distribution of information to those interested in reducing crime. Additionally, the CCCR will provide professional development for criminal justice professionals that will allow them to be more effective in their responsibilities. "We are very excited about the addition of the CCCR to the UofM Lambuth campus," said Dr. Niles Reddick , UofM Lambuth vice provost. "This will allow the UofM to better serve the needs of its West Tennessee citizens through ongoing efforts in the field of criminal justice. Dr. K.B. Turner's efforts underscore the need for more knowledge and training in the field. To have such a center at UofM Lambuth and Jackson is yet another testament to the investment in West Tennessee that the UofM continues to make." Dr. Melissa Tetzlaff-Bemiller from the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice will serve as interim coordinator for research. George Megelsh , also from Criminology and Criminal Justice, will serve as interim coordinator for professional development. The CCCR is student-oriented and will offer internships and service opportunities. The first conference will focus on juvenile violence prevention and is scheduled for April 7-8, 2016. The professional development courses will begin in early 2016.
