THE MUSEUM REIMAGINED Concept shape takes form from the shutter of a camera. The hexagon is then broken up into programmatic elements. Natural light and nature are let in through the implementation of a interior courtyard. Building design is then broken up into different elements based on program. Pathways are cut into form to allow access from all sides of the site. Building hierarchy is established by the use of differing heights on the buildings. The main building has a second floor added for classrooms, offices, and studios for guests and other photographers.
