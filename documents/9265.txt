U of M requests reduced fees for out-of-state students The University of Memphis has requested reduced fees for all students who attend the University from out of state and further reductions for undergraduate out-of-state students who live within a 250-mile radius of Memphis. If approved, these reduced fees would take effect in fall 2014 and would apply to stu dents who are already admitted to the University or who meet incoming admissions requirements, as w ell as continuing students. “This action will improve our ability to compete with other universities for students in our immediate region,” said Brad Martin, interim president. “The U of M has the ability to effectively and profitably serve out-of-state students at these reduced prices. We know from experience that more than 50 percent of the out-of-state students who graduate from the University of Memphis stay and work in the Memphis area. We believe these prices will permit us to attract more high-quality students to our campuses in Memphis and Jackson, who will make a contribution to the University of Memphis, our communities, and the Drive to 55.” Current data shows that 54 percent of out-of-state students attending the U of M rema in in the region after graduation.

Hooks Institute for Social Change will hold the “Join Hands for Chang e Gala: The Civil Rights Movement’s Influence on Music, Fashion, and Culture” April 26 beginning at 7 p .m. at The Hotel Memphis, 2625 Thousand Oaks Blvd. The Hooks Institute’s honoree for the evening will be Beverly Robertson, president of the National Civil Rights Museum. The gala will also celebrate Robertson’s dynamic leadership and vision as she ends her tenure as president of the museum. The American Civil Rights Movement successfully challenged formal legal segregation. It also created a cultural shift transforming American music, fashion and culture. Folk, blues and gospel singers crea ted harmonies and beats to drum forward the march for racial equality. Born out of the African-American Church, activ ists of the 1950s and 1960s – dressed in formal church attire – boycotted buses, sat in at segregated lunch counters, and marc hed in the streets to demand racial equality. As the movement for racial equality gained momentum in the mid-1960s, the dress of w hite and black activists transformed to reflect the political and social tide for change. Dashikis, Afros, black leather j ackets, berets, blue jeans, loose, flowing shirts, long hair and flowers all came to symbolize the 1960s.
