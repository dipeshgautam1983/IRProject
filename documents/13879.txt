Because you are sharing these networks with ton of strangers, it is important to make sure you are protected before you connect. Here are a few things to keep in mind before using public Wi-Fi. Turn off Auto Connect – This allows you more control over which networks you connect to. Only connect to secure Wi-Fi – WPA2 is the strongest type of Wi-Fi encryption. Look for https – Sites with https in the web address encrypt the data that travels from your computer to the web server. Check your firewall – Enabling your firewall helps prevent malicious software from accessing your computer through the internet. Do not enter sensitive information – Try to avoid entering sensitive information such as credit card numbers while connected to a public network. Use a VPN – A VPN secures your internet connection and encrypts all the traffic between your computer and the internet. For more information about using public Wi-Fi click Here . Posted in Facutly Resources , Student Resources Tips for Preventing Spam Posted on July 2, 2015 by Jessica Johnson Unsolicited emails can be annoying. While spam filters block most of these emails, sometimes spam can still make its way into your inbox. It is important to delete these emails because they may contain dangerous malware or viruses. Here are a few safe practices to keep in mind. Block Spammers One of the best ways to reduce the amount of spam you receive is to add senders to your blocked list. Within Outlook you can find the Block or Allows list in Options under the Accounts tab. While this will reduce the amount of spam in your inbox it will not prevent it. Spam senders often use multiple email addresses. Think Before You Share Another great way to help prevent spam is to be careful about where you share your email address. You should only give you main email address out to trusted sources. Also, before you enter your email on any websites, see what boxes are checked before you sign up. Sometimes sites will sign you up to receive email from their partners. You can also use a second email account for things like newsletters and social media. Always try to avoid posting your email address in public. Avoid Malware Never click links or download attachments from untrusted senders. Links and attachments within spam email may contain dangerous malware or viruses. Certain types of malware will target you email address book and send infected emails to other from your account. If your computer has been infected disconnect from the internet and take steps to remove the malware. Click Here for more information about spam.
