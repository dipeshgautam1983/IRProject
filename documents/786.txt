To understand these examples, you must remember these basic rules about repeats: When you repeat a course, the second attempt AND ALL SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS are used in calculating your GPA. The first attempt still appears on your transcript, but it is no longer used in calculating GPA. Important Change: Beginning with the Summer 2015 semester, the University's repeat policy will change with regard to courses that are transferred to UofM: such courses will not be used in calculating GPA. You can earn credit for a passing grade, but you cannot affect your GPA. Read more under Computing GPA (UG Catalog) . The last grade earned for a course "stands": it is always used in calculating your GPA, even if the grade is lower than a previous attempt's. For example, if you earn a D in ENGL 1010 on your first attempt, but an F on your second attempt, the F replaces the D in GPA calculation even though the D is a higher grade. Further, the last attempt can determine whether or not you have met a degree requirement. If you earn a C on your first attempt of ENGL 1010, but an F on your second attempt, not only does the F replace the C in GPA calculation, but it affects your English requirement as well. Because the F was the last grade earned and ENGL 1010 requires a C as the minimum passing grade, you would have to retake the course since the last attempt, F, is now your standing grade for this required course. As a rule, you can receive credit hours for a course only one time. For example, if you take a 3-hour course 3 times and pass it twice, you will receive only 3 hours credit, not 6. (Some courses are exceptions to this rule, but these are noted in the course description sections of the catalogs.)
