XPS is a widely used surface analysis technique. It is based on irradiating a sample with mono-energetic X-rays causing photoelectrons to be emitted from the sample surface. The binding energy of the photoelectrons is then determined by an electron energy analyzer. From the binding energies and intensities photoelectron peaks, the elemental identities, chemical states, and quantities of the elements present on a surface are determined. XPS provides information about surface layers or thin film structures that is useful for applications such as magnetic media, semiconductor and dielectric materials, electronics packaging, polymer surface modification, catalysis, corrosion, adhesion, and thin film coatings.
