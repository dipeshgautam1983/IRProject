University of Memphis Libraries | More Ways to Connect to Your Libraries&#8217; Resources! Main menu Skip to content Home University of Memphis Libraries News and Events Search for: Oct 21 2014 More Ways to Connect to Your Libraries&#8217; Resources! Posted by jschnbel We hope you had a pleasant Fall Break! As the semester progresses, we continue to offer additional ways to connect students and faculty to our resources. The University Libraries has arranged for a trial of BrowZine, a new app for mobile devices,  until November 21, 2014 . BrowZine allows users to access our paid electronic periodical content through their mobile devices in a display that emulates physical bookshelves. Sample screen from BrowZine app Here’s how to try BrowZine: From your iPad, iPhone (please note that BrowZine works best on iPad 2 or later), or Android device, download BrowZine from the App Store, Google Play, or Kindle/Amazon store and install it. When you open BrowZine for the first time, you will see a list of schools.  Select the  University of Memphis , then enter your user ID and password (same as for other University Libraries&#8217; resources). Choose the subject areas and start browsing! Don’t forget to let us know what you think of BrowZine by leaving a comment on the blog or e-mailing Cody Behles at cbehles@memphis.edu. For help finding subject-specific resources, you can explore our collection of customized online research guides. Themes of recent guides include  Network Science , the  Sociology of Gender , and  Tiger Blue Goes Green: Sustainability . The next time you’re in McWherter Library, be sure to browse our two New Additions bookcases located on either side of the Circulation desk. Acquired titles are also posted on our  Pinterest  page and often highlighted on  Twitter  and  Facebook . Research question? Keep calm and ask a librarian! Whether you are working at home or  on-campus , the University Libraries&#8217; staff is happy to help with your research. Visit our  Ask a Librarian  page for a list of FAQs and multiple ways to contact us including text, chat, and e-mail; there’s even a form you can submit if you’re having  technical difficulties  with the Libraries’ online resources. For writing help, please make an appointment with the  Center for Writing and Communication  located near the reference desk on the first floor of McWherter Library. Happy researching!
