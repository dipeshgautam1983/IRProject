The department also offers a program culminating in the professional degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (B.S.Ch.). This program is designed to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society, and is undertaken primarily by students who desire to go directly to positions in the chemical industry, or to enroll for postgraduate study in chemistry. SEQUENCE OF COURSES Students who have a score on the university's math placement exam (ALEKS) earning placement into MATH 1720 or higher should enroll in CHEM 1110 /1111 if they plan to take more than one year of college chemistry, or plan to major in either a natural science or in biomedical, civil, mechanical, or electrical engineering. CHEM 1010/1011 and 1020/1021 are for students interested in the science of chemistry, but are not credited toward a major in chemistry, biology or physics. CHEM 1010/1011 and 1020/1021 may satisfy the General Education Natural Science requirements of other majors. CHEM 1010 may be taken as preparation by students of limited high school chemistry background whose curriculum requires CHEM 1110. ADVANCED PLACEMENT Beginning students who have had previous high school training in chemistry are invited to apply for advanced placement. LABORATORY SAFETY AND COURSE REQUIREMENTS Laboratory safety is strictly practiced in the Department of Chemistry. Approved eye protection must be worn as required in all chemical laboratories. In addition, to ensure that students enrolled in laboratory courses learn the necessary safety information to safely participate in the laboratory course, all prerequisites and/or corequisites for all laboratory courses are strictly enforced. As a result, when a student enrolls in a laboratory course without prior completion of the necessary prerequisite or corequisite, the student will be dropped from the laboratory course. In addition, when a student simultaneously enrolls in a laboratory course and corequisite course, but subsequently drops or discontinues the corequisite course, the student will be dropped from the laboratory course. In the event any student fails to comply with any safety requirements of the Department of Chemistry, the department has the right to not allow the student to perform laboratory work, or to withdraw the student from the laboratory course, as appropriate. The requirements listed below are for majors and minors for the Bachelor of Science degrees or for minors for the Bachelor of Arts degrees; for detailed requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, a professional degree, see degree requirements described later in this section. NOTE: Students must complete CHEM 1110/1111, 1120/1121 before enrolling in any upper division course applied toward the major or the minor. Chemistry Major (B.S.) Program objectives for a B.S. in Chemistry and a B.S.Ch. in Chemistry are: (a) to have a satisfactory knowledge and comprehension of core concepts of analytical, organic, physical, inorganic and bioorganic chemistry; (b) to develop the ability to critically assess and solve problems relating to theoretical and practical aspects of chemistry; (c) to have satisfactory laboratory skills; (d) to have satisfactory presentation skills to communicate chemical concepts and the results of investigations into chemical phenomena, through oral and written discourse and by way of mathematical sciences (e) to have satisfactory basic computer and computational skills; (f) will be satisfactorily prepared for entry level positions in the field, or for admission to graduate or professional school; (g) to demonstrate an understanding of professional ethics and the importance of chemistry in its impact on society. A. University General Education Program (41 hours) See Graduation from the University for the University General Education Program requirements. B. College and Degree (B.S.)

Students must earn a grade of at least "C-" in CHEM 1110 and CHEM 1120 before enrolling in any upper-division CHEM course, and in CHEM 1111 and CHEM 1121 before enrolling in any upper-division CHEM laboratory course. Any CHEM (or cross-listed) course may be repeated once at the student's option to earn a minimum grade of "C-." To repeat a CHEM (or cross-listed) course a second time, a student may apply for and receive special permission from the Chemistry Department. Application information is available in the Chemistry Department Office, Room 213, J.M. Smith Chemistry Building. No student may take a CHEM (or cross-listed) course more than three times in order to earn a minimum grade of "C-" without extraordinary departmental permission. 1.

Students presenting a language to meet University admission requirements cannot receive credit for 1010 in that language. 3. No credit hours are immediately granted on the basis of the placement exam. 4. Satisfactory completion of the language requirement by means of the placement exam will be noted on the student’s transcript. 5. Students whose first college-level language course is 2010 or higher and who pass this course with a minimum grade of "C" may apply for Credit by Course Placement. The applicable fees are listed in the Miscellaneous Fees section of this Catalog. Students wishing such credit must make written application to the chair of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. Credit by Course Placement shall apply only to the lower division, and credit gained in this manner shall not exceed 12 semester hours in any one language. For additional information, see Credit by Course Placement in Section 5 of this Catalog. 6. Once a student begins with a lower-division course, all remaining higher-numbered courses in the lower division must be taken in sequence, without skipping. For example, students who begin with LATN 1010 cannot skip LATN 1020 and enroll in LATN 2010. 7.
