A minimum of 6 hours of studio art is also required. Students will select one of the following concentrations. 1.) African Diaspora Arts and Visual Culture African Diaspora Arts and Visual Culture is an interdisciplinary area of concentration within the B.A. in Art History. Its mission is to introduce students to the theoretical frameworks and methodologies for approaching the study of the diverse arts and visual cultures of peoples of African descent. Art and visual culture are examined in relation to the broader African diaspora, whereby students acquire analytical skills that enhance their understanding of historical and contemporary issues from a global perspective. Students supplement the Art History curriculum with courses drawn from a variety of disciplines. The program objectives for the concentration in African Diaspora Arts and Visual Culture emphasize research employing original sources, the ability to think and read critically, the skill of writing meaningfully, and the application of acquired knowledge in the context of cultural institutions such as museums, galleries, and historical sites. Within the requirements for the major in Art History, students in this concentration need to complete: ARTH 2020, 2030, 4184, 4185, 4186, 4187; and two courses from ARTH 4381, 4386, 4660, or 4662.

Ancient Egyptian Art and Culture The study of Ancient Egyptian art is by its very nature interdisciplinary, combing elements of visual analysis and art historical methods with textual evidence and archaeological and epigraphic fieldwork. This concentration will introduce students, at the undergraduate level, to various aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, focusing primarily on its art and its language and literature. The Egyptian objects currently in the collection of the Institute of Egyptian Art &amp; Archaeology, both on display and in storage, provide an invaluable asset to this program and will greatly enhance the students’ learning experience.
