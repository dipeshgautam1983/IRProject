Randy Buddington and Marie van der Merwe have co-authored a paper in the prestigious American Journal of Physiology: Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology. The paper, Lung Volume recruitment in a preterm pig model of lung immaturity , highlights their work using novel ventilation strategies to improve lung function in preterm infants. For more information on this work, contact Dr. Buddington at rbddngtn@memphis.edu . __________________________________________________________________________________________________ October 1, 2015 New Award: MSM as a sulfur donor Dr. Randy Buddington was recently awarded funding to investigate the incorporation of sulfur donated from methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) into rodent tissue. Sulfur is third most abundant mineral element in the body and is associated almost exclusively with amino acids. There is concern of the adequacy of the Western diet to provide adequate levels of sulfur to meet the need for synthesis of sulfur containing amino acids. Supplementing the diet with sulfur amino acids poses risks. Hence, alternative sources of sulfur are needed. This study will validate MSM as a sulfur donor based on incorporation of labeled sulfur into proteins. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ October 1, 2015 "Alive at 25" Program receives national recognition Wayne Gutch, Instructor in the School of Health Studies, has been a leader of the "Alive at 25" driving program within Shelby County for the past several years.

The purposes of this funded study are to: 1) compare self-reported fatigue, muscle soreness and inflammation when wearing one of three different types of footwear in the days following a marathon and, 2) compare ankle and knee motion among the three footwear types during level-walking. Investigators will randomly assign runners participating in the St-Jude Memphis Marathon (December 5th) to one of three footwear groups including a control group. In the weeks before the marathon, the movement of their ankles and knees will be measured during a laboratory session among the three footwear types. Then, immediately following the marathon, runners will be asked to wear the footwear type assigned to them for three days following the race. Before, immediately after, and in the days following the marathon, self-reported fatigue and muscle soreness will be measured in addition to muscle inflammation. These findings may help runners and coaches decide which footwear type may be more effective in speeding up recovery following a marathon.

See the cookbook here ! __________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 18, 2015 New Neonatal Research Facility in Roane Fieldhouse The first day of life is the most dangerous day of life and because of the immaturity of critical organ systems, this is really true for preterm infants. Unfortunately, preterm birth remains the most common cause of neonatal death and especially here in Memphis and Shelby Country. Investigators in the School of Health Studies, in collaboration with neonatologists, healthcare personnel, and industry partners are leading the world in advancing the care of preterm infants. UM research is not only helping more preterm infants survive those first hours and days after birth, it is helping preterm infants grow and develop normally and become healthy children. Notably, lung immaturity and inability to breathe (asphyxia) is the leading cause of preterm death. Research at UM is improving methods for providing ventilation support for preterm infants. Additional UM research is improving nutrition support for preterm infants improving growth and development of the brain. The Fieldhouse is not only the site of intense athletic competition, it is now supporting research that is saving the lives of infants and providing them with the chance to one day become Tigers. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 17, 2015 PETE Program Receives Distinguished Honor The Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) baccalaureate degree program was awarded national recognition by their specialized professional association (SPA), which is a significant distinction given to a teacher preparation program within the NCATE accreditation process, and is the only such program in the state of Tennessee that is noted to have acquired this honor. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ June 29, 2015 Grant Awarded The NCAA awarded a $10,000 grant to Dr. Tim Ryan, associate professor of Sport and Leisure Management in the School of Health Studies; Bob Baker, director of the Center for Athletic Academic Services; Kelly Penwell, director of the Experiential Learning Lab; and Dr. Richard Irwin, associate dean of the University College.
