Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures About Programs Languages People Study Abroad Scholarships Scholarships Application Home FL Scholarships Scholarships Thanks to an extremely generous gift from a donor, the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures is going to be able to offer substantial scholarships through the Mary Pettus Thomas Memorial Scholarship Fund to students pursuing a University of Memphis study abroad program. The exact amount awarded to each student will depend on the individual student's financial need. In order to be eligible for the scholarship, students must have a declared major in Foreign Languages, have achieved Junior standing (60 hours), have at least a 3.00 GPA, demonstrate financial need, and have a letter of support from a faculty member in the department. The funding is contingent on enrollment and participation in a study abroad program. Please note that students applying for this scholarship should also apply for the Study Abroad scholarship awarded by the Study Abroad office, which is different from this scholarship. Currently the department is NOT accepting applications. We will be posting information early in the Spring semester for students wanting to apply for Summer and Fall 2016.
