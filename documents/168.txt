GRADE POINT AVERAGE To receive a bachelor’s degree from any of the colleges in the University, students must have an overall* grade point average of at least 2.00. *Until Summer 2015, the overall GPA will reflect all college-level coursework—U of M and transfer.

Any transfer work previously processed will continue to be reflected in the GPAs.
