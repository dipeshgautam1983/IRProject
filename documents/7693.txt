LEGISLATIVE INTERNSHIP During the 2013 session of the Tennessee General Assembly, eighteen students from the University of Memphis participated in two Legislative Internship programs directed by the Department. Students who participate in either program live in Nashville during the spring semester and work in the ofﬁces of the legislative member to which they are assigned. This internship is an excellent opportunity for the students providing them with a unique opportunity to learn about the legislative process. Interns attend committee meetings, work on the legislative calendar, assist with constituent service and research prospective legislation. The internship program sponsored by the General Assembly allows a number of University students to work for members of the legislative leadership during the term. Students selected as State Interns in 2013 were Mohammed Farraj , Christopher Lewis , Leah New and Molly Pahn . The remaining fourteen students were sponsored by the University and served members of the Shelby County delegation throughout the spring academic semester. Students named for 2013 internship positions were Jade Anderson, Maria Brailsford, Erin Cox , Alexis Darvin , Gabrielle Garcia, Ciara Johnson, Jessica Kane, Kirsten Moore, Julissa Mosby, Marjorie Pritchard, Jackson Stoner, Alex Ulhmann, Sommerie Wade , Mae Yearwood . Selection for the 2014 legislative session began in September. Political Science NewsGreetings! Although the previous year was tough to beat with its exciting events and developments, we can again report to you that 2012/13 was another great year in Political Science. The progress in our graduate program continues to be very encouraging. During 2012/13, we had a record number of M.A. theses. Seven of our graduate student chose to write a thesis this past spring and summer. In the spring we held our ﬁrst Graduate Student Research Conference where our students presented the results of their research. Three of our graduate students also presented their work at the Midwest Political Science Association Conference and two of them presented at the University of Memphis Graduate Student Research Conference. Our undergraduate students also had a very good year. Political Science seniors Kevin Hayes and Nick Mastron received an Honors Program Summer Research Fellowship, and Political Science Senior Mai Orsino received the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, which is sponsored by the U.S. State Department. 62 of our Political Science majors made the Dean’s List during the fall of 2012, and 52 in the spring of 2013. Last year 52 Political Science students graduated with a B.A. As of fall 2013, 35 of our undergraduate majors are enrolled in the Helen Hardin Honors Program. The graduate program placements for our undergraduate and graduate students also continues to be strong. Last year, our students and recent alumni accepted admission into graduate programs at Emory University, Indiana University, the University of Chicago, the University of Kansas, and the University of California, Santa Cruz – among others.Our faculty also had many accomplishments. In addition to the many articles and books published by our faculty, it is noteworthy that Dr. Nicole Detraz was selected as a recipient of the College of Arts and Sciences Early Career Research Award in 2013. Also, one of Dr. Dursun Peksen’s articles received the Nils Petter Gleditsch Journal of Peace Research Article of the Year Award 2012. He was also the recipient of the Frank J. Klingberg Award for Best Paper at the 2012 International Studies Association Midwest Conference.We hope that you enjoy reading about some of the activities and accomplishments of the Political Science department. We are very proud of our alums, and would very much like to hear from you. Please share with us news about what you are doing now, and let us know if you would like to be involved in supporting your Department of Political Science. You can e-mail me at mkaelbrr@memphis.edu.

There you will ﬁnd updates on developments in the department and you have another way of communicating with us. In any case, we look forward to hearing from you. Cordially, !"##$%"&'(")*+),),Matthias KaelbererDepartment Chair A NOTE FROM THE CHAIR Fall 2013 News from the Department of Political Science In 2012-2013, students in Mock Trial traveled in both the Fall and Spring semesters to compete against other universities. In the fall, members of the class attended the Billiken Barrister Invitational in St. Louis, Missouri, along with approximately 22 other schools. In spring 2013, the traveling team attended the American Mock Trial Association Midwest Regional at Mississippi College in Jackson, Miss. Bob Huddleston received an award for Best Witness, and Maria Brailsford received an award for Best Attorney. The 2013-14 Mock Trial Team starts the year with four returning members (Brandon McCoy , Bob Huddleston, Prataj Ingram and Sarah Wombough ) and seven new members. This year’s case will be a felony murder case with conspiracy issues that promises to be exceptionally challenging. MOCK TRIAL MODEL UNITED NATIONS 3In February 2013, the University of Memphis sent a student delegation to the Midwest Model United Nations (MMUN) conference in St. Louis, Missouri. The second year of the rejuvenated University of Memphis Model UN program saw the number of student-delegates participating almost double, from six in 2012 to eleven in 2013. The University of Memphis delegation, along with advisor Dr. Paul Mego , traveled to St. Louis to represent the Russian Federation at the MMUN simulation. The 2013 conference drew over 500 student delegates from approximately 50 different colleges and universities representing about 80 different countries. The Russian Federation is an important country in the United Nations organization as one of the only ﬁve members of the UN Security Council with a permanent seat and veto power. The Memphis delegates had to be ﬁrmly on top of their diplomatic game in order to accomplish simulation objectives. This certainly proved to be the case, as the University of Memphis Security Council delegate Nicholas Mastron came home with the highly-competitive conference Security Council Outstanding Delegate award and the Security Council Delegates’ Choice award. The University of Memphis Model United Nations organization emphasizes participation in United Nations simulation exercises that help interested students to increase their knowledge and appreciation for the complex world of 21st century international relations. Members of a delegation learn about the policies of a speciﬁc country toward the United Nations and through well-organized activities such as would take place in the actual UN, engage in the art of diplomatic negotiation and compromise in regard to certain topics that are real-world problems faced by current UN delegations This academic year, the University of Memphis delegation will represent Israel at the St. Louis Midwest Model UN conference with several returning student-delegates and several new ones. The 2014 MMUN conference will take place in February. The UMMUN has become increasingly popular over the last year and we’re happy to see it active and growing! Dr. Mego also hopes to be able to organize and send another delegation to the 2014 MMUN conference drawn from students on the University of Memphis, Lambuth campus in Jackson, where he is based.Mock Trial Team members: Allen Porter, Brandon McCoy and Hunter Dawson These U of M students represented The Russian Federation in a United Nations simulation at the Midwest Model United Nations Conference in St. Louis. 7VALERIE HUDSON LECTURE STUDY ABROAD REPORT In the summer 2013, Lisa Huffstetler and Dr. Matthias Kaelberer took a group of students to London and Berlin to study state formation and national identities in Europe. Among the sites visited on this trip were the parliaments in both cities, the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, the Holocaust Memorial, the Berlin Wall Memorial and Cecilienhof (picture) – the site of the Potsdam Conference. Last fall the Political Science Department, along with the Inter -national Studies Program, helped to bring in a speaker for the Marcus Orr Center for the Humanities (MOCH) lecture series. On November 14, Dr. Valerie Hudson gave a talk about her recent co-authored book Sex and World Peace (published by Columbia University Press). Dr. Hudson is a Professor and the George H. W. Bush Chair of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A & M University.

It is committed to education of a non-racially identiﬁable student body. UOM205-FY1314/2M5CYOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL! Private gifts are increasingly important, as support from state and federal sources decline. Every investment makes a difference. Support from the University’s alumni, family, and friends enables our community to maximize its potential by providing more opportunities more often. To remain competitive with our peer institutions, gifts to the Political Science Department help: • attract and retain high-caliber faculty members and students – see, for example, the tremendous publication successes of our junior faculty members.• provide additional scholarship dollars to our undergraduates – check out, among others, the tournament schedule of our Mock Trial Team and Model UN Team. • increase graduate stipends – a great example of the quality of our graduate program is the fact that our graduate students Joe Lenhart, Clint Thompson and Drew Wagstaff presented papers at the Midwest Political Science Association Conference. • assist with scholarly travel – six of our faculty members travelled to the International Studies Association convention in San Francisco last year.
