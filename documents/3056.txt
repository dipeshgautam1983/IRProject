EVEA Logon Login: University Email Address: @memphis.edu Password: The Tennessee Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) became effective on October 1, 2012. The EVEA requires state public institutions of higher education to verify that persons seeking a "state public benefit" are either a "United States citizen" or "lawfully present" in the United States. *We recommend you use Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox 16+ or Google Chrome 24+ In an effort to protect the privacy of those students applying to the University of Memphis, students must be admitted to the University before they can submit any documents using this site. Applicants need to know that the documents requested in EVEA are not required for admission and have no bearing on the admission decision in any way.
