THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS-Agreement to Accept the Visa Purchasing Card Agreement to Accept the Visa Purchasing Card Click here for online help. Return form to: Procurement and Contract Services The University of Memphis 115 Administration Building Memphis, TN 38152 Your participation in the Visa Purchasing Card Program is a convenience that carries responsibilities along with it. Although the card is issued in your name, it should be considered University property and should be used with good judgment. Your signature below verifies that you understand the Visa Purchasing Program guidelines outlined below and agree to comply with them as well as comply with the University procedure for the Purchasing Card Program. The Visa Purchasing card is provided to employees based on their need to purchase business-related goods for the University. A card may be revoked at any time based on change of assignment or location. The card is not an entitlement nor reflective of title or position. The card is for business-related purchases only; personal charges are not to be made to the card. You are the only person entitled to use the card and are responsible for all charges made against the card. Improper use of the card can be considered misappropriation of University funds, which may result in disciplinary action, up to, and including termination. All charges are billed directly to and paid by the University. It is a violation of this agreement and University procedure to make personal charges with this card. Cardholders are expected to comply with University procedures. This includes, but is not limited to, keeping receipts, reconciling Visa Purchasing statements and following proper card security procedures. Cardholders are responsible for reconciling the Visa Purchasing monthly statement, and resolving any discrepancies by contacting the supplier or the bank. Each account is assigned a FOAP code by the University and purchases will be automatically charged to that code. Codes can be changed by the University but only within procedure. A lost or stolen card should be reported immediately by telephone to Regions Bank at 1-888-934-1087, and to the Procurement Specialist at 901-678-3673. A cardholder must surrender his/her card upon termination of employment (i.e. retirement or voluntary/involuntary termination). At this point, no further use of the account is authorized. __________________________________________ Cardholder Signature __________________________________________ Procurement Specialist Signature __________________________________________ Cardholder Printed Name __________________________________________ Procurement Specialist Printed Name ____________________ Date ____________________ Date A Tennessee Board of Regents Institution An Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action University
