DPDwiggins D. P. Dwiggins, PhD Department of Mathematical Sciences The University of Memphis ddwiggns@memphis.edu Welcome to My Home Page! University of Memphis Web Site x Class Schedule I am currently serving as an instructor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Memphis. I teach applied mathematics, including pre-calculus and calculus courses, differential equations, applied analysis, and numerical analysis. I also serve as advisor for undergraduate math majors, and occasionally teach engineering and physics courses as well. My research involves functional analysis and methods of analyzing solutions to integral equations and functional differential equations, including infinite-delay equations. Recently I have been working on problems in combinatorics and quantum mechanics. Please use the links at left to access the websites for the classes I teach.
