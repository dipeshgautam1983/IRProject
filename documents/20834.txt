Graduate Program in Sociology A. Introduction to the Program The Department offers graduat e studies leading to the Master of Arts in Sociology. Training in theory, research methods, and statistics is required of all students. In addition, the program offers a wide selection of courses in many substantive areas such as race, class and gender stu dies; stratification; globalization and social change; family; deviance; organizations; religion, and medical sociology. The program provides opportunities to develop skills and interests in specific specialty areas while obtaining a solid grounding in s ociological theory and soci al research methods. It also offers a high level of student - faculty interaction and the opportunity to participate in supervised research. The exposure to a full range of sociologi cal specialties allows our graduates to apply to and be accepted by a wide range of Ph.D. programs. It is also appropriate for students who want to apply to law schools or other professional programs or work in areas of applied research. There are two degree options availa ble to students p in sociology - - a thesis program (24 hours of graduate course work plus 6 hours of credit for writing a thesis) or a non - thesis program (33 hours of graduate course work with both written and oral comprehensive examinations that cover sociological theory, research methods and statistics ). B. Advising Studen oordinator who assists them in course planning and keeps them informed of departmental, college, and, university requirements and policies. St udents should consult with the graduate c oordinator often. 5 II. Program Requirements Students may choose a thesis program or a non - thesis program. The requirements for each are list ed below. All students , whether they select the thesis program or the non - thesis program, must take three core courses: SOCI 6312 (I ntermediate Social Statistics), SOC I 7210 (Theory Seminar), and SOCI 7320 (Methods of Social Research). Students must ear n a minimum grade of Students who Graduate school policy earned in the seco nd attempt will be included in the computation of the cumulative grade (see the Graduate Bulletin .) A. The Thesis Program 30 semester ho urs of graduate level work, which includes 24 - 27 hours of course work and a minimum of 3 hours and a maximum of 6 hours of SOCI 7996 (Thesis). Only 6 hours of course work can be at the 6000 level. No more than 6 semester hours of Directed Individual Study (SOCI 7912) can be applied to degree requirements . Only 9 hours involving some combination of Directed Individual Study and courses outside of sociology may count toward degree requirements. The student must pass an oral thesis defense that counts as a t hesis defense and a comprehensive exam. B. The Non - Thesis Program 33 semester hours of graduate course work, only 6 hours of which can be at the 6000 level. At least 27 semester hours of graduate course work must be in sociology. No more than 6 semest er hours of Directed Individual Study (SOCI 7912) can be applied to degree requirements. Only 9 hours involving some combination of Directed Individual Study and courses outside of sociology may count toward degree requirements . The student must pass a comprehensive examination that includes a written and an oral component. The exam covers 1) sociological theory, 2) sociological research methods and 3) statistics . 6 II I . Graduate Curriculum A. Course Cognates Graduate level courses are listed at the 6000, 7000, and 8000 levels. C ou r ses offered at the 6000 level are co - listed at the 4000 level and are open to graduate students and undergraduate students. Graduate students should enroll for these courses at the 6000 level. Requirements for graduate students in 4000/6000 level course s are more stringent than those for undergraduate students. Many courses listed at the 7000 level are also co - listed at the 8000 level and are open only to graduate students. Masters level students should enroll for these courses at the 7000 level. Ph D students enroll for them at the 8000 level. B. Course Offerings Students shoul d consult online Graduate Bulletin for current information on courses, course descriptions, credit hours, and prerequisites. The D epartment offers Dire cted Individual Studies (DIS) courses that allow students to undertake advanced reading and/or research in special areas of interest. Before taking an independent studies course , students must receive the permission of a facult y member willing to supervis e the DIS , the graduate coordinator , and the department chair . The faculty member will prepare a contract for the course of study, which the faculty member and student should date and sign. The contract should be filed with the graduate coordinator for placement in the student - F or IP (in progress). Students cannot one semester, the faculty member supervising the DIS may give the stude A grade of "IP," does not carry any quality points and is not included in computing the GPA C. Course Scheduling Required courses (Theory Seminar SOCI 7210, Intermediate Statistics SOCI 6312, and Seminar in Methods of Social Research program as po ssible. SOCI 7210 and SOCI 7320 are offered every fall semester and SOCI 6312 is offered every spring semester. To ensure broad coverage of the discipline, the Department offers as many different courses as possible over four consecutive semesters (not counting summer sessions). Other than required courses we rarely offer the same course mo re than once in a two year period. Thus, students should enroll for desired electives as soon as they are offered, as these electives are unlikely to be offered again during their course of study. 7 IV . Polici es and Procedures A. Continuous Enrollment Once accepted into the sociology graduate program, a student must enroll every semester thereafter (excluding summer sessions). If a student fails to do so, he/she must apply for readmission, which may or ma y not be granted. Readmitted students follow the rules and degree requirements listed in the most current Graduate Bulletin (see the Graduate Bulletin for additional information about readmissions). Students writing a thesis must enroll for at least 1 hou r of thesis credit every fall and Graduate Bulletin ). If a student completes a thesis durin g a summer term, he/she must be enrolled during that term (see the Graduate Bulletin for exceptions to this policy). B. Non - Program Students enrolled for graduate courses at The U niversity of Memphis but who have not been accepted into a graduate program have graduate non - degree status. Non - degree students who decide to matriculate for a degree in sociology must apply to the Graduate School and meet all admissions requirements for the Graduate School and the Department of Sociology. Non - graduate credit hours earned while a non - degree student to degree requirements in sociology. However, at least six o f these hours must be in graduate level sociology lower earned while a non - degree student will not be applied toward degree requirements in sociology. Graduate School p graduate level coursework, the non - degree student must sign a release agreeing that Graduate Bulletin ). Non - degree students c annot be awarded graduate assistantships. 8 C. Academic Probation and Departmental Review A graduate student whose cumulative grade point average in sociology drops below 3.00 will be placed on departmental review. Being on departmental review at the conclusion of a subsequent semester may result in suspension. Conditions under which continuation in the program beyond two or more semesters on departmental review will be granted must be recommended by the department's graduate committee and the department chair. If, in the opinion of the grad uate committee, the chair, the College of Arts and Sciences' Associate Dean of Graduate Programs and Research, and the Vice Provost for Graduate Programs, the student is not making satisfactory progress toward degree completion, the student will be dismiss ed from the degree program. Students are ineligible for graduate assistantships while on departmental review, but may apply/reapply for an assistantship once their departmental review status has been removed. D. Incomplete Grades According to Graduate School policy, students must complete the requirements to remove a grade of "I" (incomplete) wit hin 90 days from the end of the semester or summer term in which it was received. An incomplete not removed within 90 days changes to an "F." If unusual circumstances prevent the student from removing the "I" within 90 days, a 45 - day extension may be gran ted. It is the student's responsibility to request an extension. Students who receive an "I" that changes to an "F" may submit a written request to the graduate committee for a grade change. The request must be made after the student has completed require ments for the cours e and must spell out the reasons why the student was unable to complete the requirements for the course prior to the "I" becoming an "F." In addition, the request must be made within one year of the beginning of the semester or term in w hich the student enrolled in the course. If the facul ty member who gave the student the "I" and the G raduate C ommittee agree that extraordinary circumstances prevented the student from completing requirements for the course before the "I" changed to an "F, " they will recommend to the department chair that the student's "F" be changed. If the chair agrees with the recommendation of the faculty member and the graduate committee, the chair will recommend to the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies that the student's grade be changed. E . Course Load Restrictions Graduate students generally are not permitted to take more than 15 semester hours during regular sessions or more than 12 semester hours during summer sessions. University - funded graduat e assistants must register for at least 9 hours of credit per semester. Requests to take more than 15 semester hours require the approval of the Workshop in 9 Professional Development for Gr aduate Assistants) do not count toward degree requirements. F. Time Limitations completed in six years. Courses older than these limits will not be allowed as credit towar d the master's degree, although the grades will be calculated in the cumulative he Graduate Bulletin . The course validation form can be accessed at: . limits will be shown on the transcript and will be calculated in the cumulative GPA, but will not be accepted for G. Classroom Conduct states tha responsibility seriously. Students should familiarize themselves with the entire document, which can be accessed at: They should also review examples of unacceptable (disruptive) classroom behav ior by going to: %20Disrupt ive%20Classroom%20Behaviors.docx The Department expects students to attend all class meetings and encourages students to attend departmental activities/events (e.g., research presentations, social gatherings, etc.) H. Academic Dishonesty The Department of Sociology does not tolerate any form of academic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarizing, forger y, and falsification). Students should familiarize in : 10 They should also familiarize themselves with: the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities : , procedures for academic discipline: , and - trd/howto/pl agiarism.htm require students to submit their written work to TurnItIn.com , which uses an online database to determine 11 V . Graduate Student Resources A. Financial Aid The University Fina ncial Aid Office (10 3 Wilder Tower, 901 - 678 - 4824) provides information on a variety of forms of financial support (loans, scholarships, etc.) . See their website for additional information. B. Graduate Assistantships/Work Study/GA - Work Study Contracts Graduate Assistantships . The Department of Sociology a wards full - time and part - time graduate assistantships to its most qualified applicants. Full - time assistantships require 20 hours of work per week in the department, pay a monthly stipend for eight months, and include a full tuition and fee waiver (includi ng out - of - state tuition, if applicable). Part - time assistantships require 10 hours of work per week, pay a monthly stipend for eight months, and include a waiver of half the student's tuition and fees. Students who receive full - time or part - time assistants hips must enroll for 12 graduate credit hours per semester, maintain satisfactory work performance, and maintain a GPA of "3.0" or higher. Students awarded an assistantship when they first enter our program typically remain on the assistantship for four consecutive semesters (excluding summer terms). Students awarded an assistantship after completing one, two, or three semesters of coursework in our program typically remain on the assistantship for three, two, or one semesters, respectively. Graduate as sistant (GA) duties include assisting faculty members with scholarly activities an d research. At the end of each fall and s pring semester, the faculty member will be responsible for submitting, in a timely manner, standardized performance evaluations for e ach GA assigned. The evaluati on form appears in Appendix B. Ethics for issues in professional work. The guidelines appear on the ASA website at : . development. All activities of graduate assistants are to be carried out under the super vision and direction of faculty. Specific tasks vary. Scholarly activities may include but are not limited to the following: Library research (e.g., conducting literature searches, obtaining copies of published articles, reports, books, or government do cuments; information gathering from the Internet) Data collection and management Data analysis Preparation of papers and presentations for professional meetings Using and/or developing technology to assist classroom instruction 12 Proctoring Opportunities to guest lecture Graduate assistants are expected to: Complete assignments thoroughly and in a timely manner Maintain communication with the department office, the graduate coordinator, and the assigned faculty member Department funded graduate assistantshi ps do not receive tuition and fee waivers during summer sessions. However, students who are graduate assistants or teaching assistants in the spring semester pay in - state tuition rates for the summer sessions. For additional information about graduate ass istantships, see Work Study . Students who apply for a graduate assistantship should also apply for work study support through the Fr ee Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Graduate assistants who apply and qualify for this support earn more as graduate assistants than students who do not apply. To receive priority consider ation for work study support, students should apply by March 1 for the f all semester and by October 1 for the s pring semester. The University Finan cial Aid website ( ) explains how to begin the process. You can access the electron ic form at . GA and Work Study Contracts . GA and work study contracts should reach the Graduate School by early August and MUST reach the Graduate School by the 4th day of classes . Students who do not sign their contracts in time to be turned in to the Graduate School by the 4 th day of classes will not receive tuition and fees waivers . C. Teach ing Assistantships/Work Study/TA - Work Study Contracts Teaching Assistantships . Students who have taken the required graduate theory, methods, and statistics courses, who have a total of at least 18 hours of graduate coursework in sociology, and who have a 3.3 or higher graduate level GPA may apply for a teaching assistantship (TA). Students apply by having a faculty member write a letter to the Graduate Committee that spells out why the student is qualified to teach. Students who are awarded a TA teach one section of Introductory Sociology per semester. Prior to teaching the course for the first time, students must: attend a department - sponsored teaching workshop, attend a university - sponsored teaching workshop, draft a course syllabus and other mate rials (The syllabus will be reviewed by one or more faculty members and returned to the student for changes.), attend several meetings of an Introductory Sociology class taught by an experienced teacher. (At least one meeting should be a lab session.), 13 become familiar with the Department of Sociology Handbook for Adjunct Faculty and Graduate Teaching Assistant s , which can be obtained from the the Faculty Handbook , agree give the student feedback on his/her teaching, students may be reassigned subject to a review of their teaching evaluations. Students who teach their own courses should rank thei r teaching responsibilities among their highest priorities. Such practices as cancelling class without finding a substitute, arriving to class late, letting class out early, being unprepared for class, and failing to grade student tests and assignments in a timely manner are unacceptable. A more Handbook for Adjunct Faculty and Graduate Teaching Assistants and the Faculty Handbook . Students who are unable to give teaching responsibilit ies high priority should not apply for teaching assistantships. Work Study . S tudents who want to be considered for a teaching assistantship should also apply for work study support through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Since li mited departmental funds are available for TAs, it is important that their wages are supplemented by work study money. If a student does not apply for and receive work study money, it is possible the Department will not be able to fund the ll other things being equal, preference will be given to students who have had the most coursework, as we believe they are the most qualified.

Students who do not sign their contracts in time to be turned in to the Graduate School by the 4 th day of classes will not receive tuition and fees waivers . Department funded teaching assistantships do not receive tuition and fee w aivers during summer sessions. However, students who are teaching assistants in the Spring semester pay in - state tuition rates for summer sessions. For additional information about teaching assistantships, see: 14 D. Travel to Professional Meetings We strongly encourage our graduate students to present their research in professional settings. ctice of having graduate students present their research as part of our Research Colloquium Series and/or at professional meetings. Our students often present their research first at our Research Colloquium Series ofessional meeting. Subject to availability of funds, students may request up to $300 in travel funds if they present a research paper at an appropriate professional association conference. Students can apply for additional travel funds through the Gradu ate Student Association ( ) and they can apply for a Dunavant Travel Grant awarded by The University of Memphis. E. Support for Th esis and Other Student Research To carry out thesis projects, students may need financial assistance to cover the costs of su ch things as supplies and data sets. The Department makes every attempt to provide financial support for these projects. The Univer sity of Memphis is a member of the Inter - University Consortium on Political and Social Research ( ). This membership gives students ready access to a wide range of data sets that can be used for thesis and independent research projects. Students also have access to a large number online data sets not included in ICPSR (see Appendix C). T wo large computer labs with a wide array of current software program s are located in Clement Hall and available for student use. F. Student Paper Award Every year we have a grad uate student paper award. The papers are judged by the Graduate Committee on their originality, organization, substantive content, and written competence. The winner receives $3 0 0 . If only one paper is submitted, it may still receive the award if the Graduate Committee deems it to be outstanding. 15 VI . Procedures for Writing a Thesis A. Thesis Committee Composition Students who plan to write a thesis must first select a committee chair. Together the student and chair will select at least two faculty members to compose a thesis c ommittee. Each committee member must have associate graduate faculty status, full graduate faculty status, adjunct research co - mentor status, or affiliate graduate faculty status. Full or associate graduate faculty may chair committees and adjunct research co - mentor members may serve as a co - chair. Only one adjunct or affiliate graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member. One member of the committee may be from a department other than sociology. However, the student should have a good reason for including a non - sociologist on his/her committee (e.g., the non - sociologist has specialty area experti se or - committee is not discouraged . As soon as the student has selected a thesis committee, he/she should submit a Thesis/Dissertation Faculty Committee form to the College Director of Graduate ally, full - time students should file this form before their third semester of coursework. The form can be accessed by going to : . B. Thesis Pro posal Defense and Selecting the Thesis/Non - Thesis Option . Full - time students who select the thesis option should defend their thesis proposal early in their third semester of coursework . (See Appendix D for resources that will assist stude nts in writing a proposal.) Any student who has not defended a proposal after accumulating 36 credit hours will automatically be assigned to the non - thesis option and will be expected to take the written and oral comprehensive exam as soon as possible . C hours, but thesis hours do. After students successfully defend their proposal, they must file the Thesis/ Dissertation Proposal Defense form with the College Director of Graduate Stud ies. A copy of the form should also be submitted to the departmental graduate coordinator. Upon submission of a copy to the graduate coordinator, the student has formally selected the Students are assumed to be on the non - thesis track u ntil they submit this form. The form can be accessed by going to : . 16 If a student decides to change from the thesis option back to the non - thesis option , she/he must inform the graduate coordinator in writing of the change and submit the necessary Graduate School form. Any thesis hours the student has accumulated will not count toward the 33 hours of coursework needed for the non - thesis option. C. Thesis Preparation and Defense Students should familiarize themselves with the Thesis/Dissertation Preparation Guide ( ) as soon as they st art work on their thesis. This Guide contains information on thesis formatting (e.g., requirements for the Table of Contents, margins, type of paper, table formats, etc.) that must be followed Appendix D includes resources that will assist students in writing their thesis. When the student has completed his/her thesis to the satisfaction of his/her Thesis Committee Chair, his/her Committee Chair should schedule a thesis defense meeting with all Graduate School thesis deadlines in mind. The graduate coordinator will keep students and faculty informed of these deadlines, but ultimately responsibility re of all Graduate School deadlines . These deadlines are posted at . The oral Thesis Defense counts as both a thesis defense and a comprehens ive exam . During the defense, students are asked broad questions covering the breadth of coursework as well as the thesis content. Comprehensive Exam Results form ( ) and a Thesis Defense Results form ( ) must be submitt ed to the College Director of Graduate Studies. It is the responsibility of the submit these forms . Copies of these forms should in the student s permanent file. The Thesis/Dissertation Checklist must be submitted to the Graduate School with the defended and corrected copy of the thesis. Both the student and the major professor must check all applicable items and sign at the bottom. T he Checklist can be accessed at his.edu/gradschool/pdfs/non - apa_checklist.pdf . D. Time - Line for Thesis Option Students Full - time students who select the thesis option should meet the following deadlines to ensure timely completion of the thesis. The graduate coordinator will make adjustments to these deadlines for part - time students. 17 1. Select a Thesis Committee and turn in the Thesis/Dissertation Faculty C ommittee form before the beginning of the third semester of study (before enrolling for more than 18 hours of coursework that count toward degree requirements). 2. Gain Institutional Review Board (human rights) approval for the thesis after submitting the Th esis/Dissertation Faculty Committee form and before defending the thesis proposal. Before applying for IRB approval, students should review the learning modules at the Education in Responsible Conduct in Research website. Applicants for IRB approval need to provide documentation that they have reviewed these modules . Go to the IRB website ( ) for more information. 3. Defend the Thesis Proposal early in the third semester of coursework and by th e end of the third semester at the latest (before completing 27 hours of coursework that count toward degree requirements). Any student who has not defended a thesis proposal after 36 credit hours will automatically be assigned to the non - thesis option. thesis hours do. 4. Defend the thesis during the fourth or fifth semester of coursework. 18 VII . Protocol for the Administration and Evaluation of Comprehens ive Examinations A. Administration of Comprehensive Examinations As mentioned above, the oral thesis defense counts as both a thesis defense and as a comprehensive exam for students who select the thesis option . During the defense, students are aske d general questions covering the breadth of coursework as well as specific questions regarding the thesis content. Students who select the non - thesis option are required to take a comprehensive examination that includes a take - home, open - book, written com ponent and an oral component. The exam covers sociological theory, research methods, and statistics The student will not be expected to answer all the questions on the examination, but will be given options to select or omit certain questions. A bank of questions previously asked on the exams, along with some other potential questions, will be made available. However, there is no guarantee that all, or even any of the questions on a particular examination will be drawn from the bank. The examination will be distributed on a Friday and will be due by noon, a week from the following Monday. Examinations are to be turned in electronically in MSWord format. Supplementary materials, such a s output from statistical or graphing programs may be turned in as appendices either in their native format or as PDF files. Such materials should be carefull y cross - referenced in the MSWord document. Students are required to work independently. The Comprehensive Examination will be administered and evaluated by the Sociology Graduate Faculty (See Section IX). During the oral, committee members may ask any qu estion. However, students are strongly encouraged to prepare for the oral by studying material they believe could help them strengthen their written answers. Upo n completion of the oral, a Comprehensive Exam Results form ( ) must be submitte d to the College Director of Graduate Studies . A copy of the form should also be submitted to the permanent file. It is the responsibility of the Comprehensive Exam Committee to submit this form to both the College Director of Graduate St udies and to the Departments Graduate Coordinator. Comprehensive exams are scheduled by the graduate coordinator and are typically offered twice a year (late October and early April ). Students usually take the exam in their last semester of coursework. T ypically, the oral is held on a Friday approximately two weeks after the written component has been turned in. The date for the administration of the written component, the date the written component is due, and the date orals will be held will be announc ed early each semester. Students planning to take the Comprehensive Exam in a particular semester must inform the Graduate Coordinator in writing no later than the Friday of the first full week of classes. 19 B. Evaluation of Comprehensive Examination s A departmental Comprehensive Examination Committee writes and evaluates the comprehensive examination. The departmental Comprehensive Examination Committee will be comprised of members of the graduat e faculty. The chair of the Committee will rotate among the members of the graduate faculty. The student's overall performance on the written and oral compo nents of the exam must be acceptable to the e xamination Committee. A favo rable vote by a majority of the c ommittee members is needed for the student to pass the examination. However, the - write pa rts of the written exam it deems to be deficient. The Committee decides how much time to give the student to complete the re - write and whether or not a second oral is needed. VI II . Procedures and Criteria for Graduation A. Admission to Candidacy The following University requirements must be met during the semester the student graduates: The Master's Degree Candidacy - click here for instructions - form and an Intent to Graduate Form must be filed by the deadline indicated at the University of Memphis website. These deadlines typically occur during second w eek of the fall and spring Graduate Bulletin ). The graduate coordinator will keep student s informed of all deadlines related to graduation. Ultimately, however, it is the these deadlines. They can be found at: . - level GPA is 3.0 or higher at the time the Intent to Graduate Card is filed (see the Graduate Bulletin ). Grades of "D" or "F" do not count toward graduate de gree requirements, but are computed in the GPA. No more than seven hours of "C+," "C," or "C - " count toward degree requirements. mesters must be removed when the Intent to Graduate Card is filed. 20 B. Enrollment Requirements Students must be enrolled during the semester they defend the thesis. In addition, they must be enrolled during the semester they intend to graduate, regard less of when the comprehensive exam was taken. However, if students defend their thesis after the spring deadline and before the first summer school session starts, they may graduate in August without enrolling for summer school. IX .
