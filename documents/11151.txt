Dashboard Upgrades Coming Soon! | blogs.memphis.edu blogs.memphis.edu The University of Memphis Enterprise Blog Service Menu Skip to content Home About Blogs at UofM Getting Started Site Search Support Dashboard Upgrades Coming Soon! Edublogs Campus Networks is rolling out the latest version of WordPress in the coming days. WordPress is the system blogs.memphis.edu runs on. Upgrades will continue to roll out in waves and there&#8217;s not a specific day/time to know when our site will pass through. You will know when our site is complete when you first log in, as the dashboard will have a different look and feel. Everything will remain in the same layout and location, but the environment will be more modern and user friendly. The biggest improvement is that the dashboard will be completely mobile, touch, and tablet friendly, meaning it is much easier to write a new post or manage a site from any web browser on any device &#8211; no special app needed! Edublogs is also in the process of updating the screenshots on the Edublogs support site . If you have any questions, please contact the umTech Helpdesk at 901.678.8888 or email umblogs@memphis.edu .
