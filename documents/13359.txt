Because you are sharing these networks with ton of strangers, it is important to make sure you are protected before you connect. Here are a few things to keep in mind before using public Wi-Fi. Turn off Auto Connect – This allows you more control over which networks you connect to. Only connect to secure Wi-Fi – WPA2 is the strongest type of Wi-Fi encryption. Look for https – Sites with https in the web address encrypt the data that travels from your computer to the web server. Check your firewall – Enabling your firewall helps prevent malicious software from accessing your computer through the internet. Do not enter sensitive information – Try to avoid entering sensitive information such as credit card numbers while connected to a public network. Use a VPN – A VPN secures your internet connection and encrypts all the traffic between your computer and the internet. For more information about using public Wi-Fi click Here .
