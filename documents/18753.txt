Disability Resources for Students About Access Accommodations Technology Policies Career Programs Faculty About DRS Office DRS Staff FAQs Important Terms for DRS Home Disability Resources for Students About DRS Office DRS Office Office Hours: Monday through Friday 7:30 A.M. - 4:30 P.M. Fall and Spring Semesters 8:00 A.M. - 4:30 P.M. Summer Semester and Semester Breaks After hours appointments available until 6:30 P.M. upon request Comments? Problems? Questions? E-mail: Susan Te Paske ( stepaske@memphis.edu ), Director (please address the "Subject Line" as Information Request) The DRS staff is responsible for receiving and reviewing all medical and psycho-educational documentation to determine if students meet the legal definition of having a disability and to determine eligibility for specific academic accommodations. DRS retains all disability information in the student's confidential file and the information is not released without the consent of the student. Faculty members and other staff do not have access to the medical and psycho-educational reports. With the student's consent, DRS staff may interpret the information to faculty or other staff in the course of arranging special accommodations or support services. Disability information is not included on academic transcripts. The confidential files are maintained in DRS for a period of five years after the student leaves the University and are then shredded. DRS is staffed with experienced professionals who strive to provide students with the appropriate tools, resources and guidance to help them develop the personal, academic and independence skills necessary to prepare them for a competitive college environment and for the world of work. While working with DRS is voluntary on the student's part, the DRS staff especially encourages regular contact for first-year students to ensure that they get off to a good start and that timely interventions can be made to resolve any problems that may arise. The DRS office is usually a very busy place. This is especially true during the month before and after the beginning of a semester and during exams. It is necessary for DRS staff to work appointment, and students are responsible for scheduling their appointments.
