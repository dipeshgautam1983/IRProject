Please see the University of Memphis (see the Office of Student Conduct ) for additional expectations. Student's Expectations My personal goal is to help you gain knowledge and insight into the fundamental concepts of operations through the material presented, the homework assigned, the classroom and online participation and any personal experience I can share during this semester. Therefore, in my role as your instructor, there are certain things you can expect from me including a well - organized and engaging learning experience based on my profession al experiences in multiple industries , response to emails within two (2) business days, and feedba ck on all work submitted within 7 - 10 calendar days. Student's Effort Past experience suggests that this can be a very difficult course for some. We experience in industrial, commercial or service industries; this makes absorption of the material difficult. However, we cover these subjects in a rather shallow manner sin ce this is an overview course; specifically we study about 700 of the 900 page textbook information; you are expected to have read the scheduled chapters prior to that n participate in discussion and ask clarifying questions. This is a required course for many students and is often taken as part of a full - time student course load. The expected effort is based on a full time student spending 40 hours per week after combi ning all of your classes, homework, teamwork, reading and other research across all of your classes. Since this 3 credit - hour course is 20% to 25% of a full time student course load, I expect you to spend 8 to 10 hours per week working on this course whet her you are a full time or part time student. Since approximately 3 hours of that time will be spent in class, the remaining 5 - 7 hours are allocated to the course requirements listed in this section. Therefore, most of your learning will occur outside of the classroom. Please put your investment of time and money to good use. The quantity of your time and effort spent on this class is not a factor in your grade (see the next section).
