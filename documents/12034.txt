This discussion has been prepared by management along with the financial statements and related note disclosures and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes. The financial statements, notes, and this discu ssion are the responsibility of management. Using This Annual Report This report consists of three basic financial statements. The Statement of Net Assets; the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets; and the Statement of Cash Flows p rovide information on the University of Memphis as a whole and present a long - term view of the U The Statement of Net Assets The Statement of Net Assets presents the financial position of the U niversity at the end of the fiscal ye ar and includes all assets and liabilities of the U niversity. The difference between total assets and total liabilities net assets is an indicator of the current financial condition of the U niversity. Assets and liabilities are generally measured usi ng current values. One notable exception is capital assets, which are stated at historical cost less an allowance for depreciation. Net assets are divided into three major categories. The first category, invested in capital assets, net of related debt, provides the equity in property, plant, and equipment owned by the University . The next asset category is restricted net assets, which is divided into two categories, nonexpendable and expendable. The corpus of nonexpendable restricted resou rces is only available for investment purposes. Expendable restricted net assets are available for expenditure by the University but must be spent for purposes as determined by donors and/or external entities that have placed time or purpose restrictions on the use of the assets. The final category is unrestricted net assets. Unrestricted net assets are available to the institution for any lawful purpose of the institution. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2010 4 Comparison of FY 20 10 to FY 200 9 Net Capital Assets increased by $ 4 8 million primarily due to the constructio n of the new University Center, Living Learning Complex (formerly West Hall ) and the renova tion of the D owntown Law School. The decrease in Current Liabilities is the result of a $9 million liability due to the State of Tennessee for the FY 20 09 allotment of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) State Fiscal Stabilization Funds (SFSF) th at was drawn down and receipted as of June 30, 2009. This entire allotment was returned to the State of Tennessee on July 21, 2009. These funds were received in FY 2010 on a n incremental reimbursement basis after expenses were incurred. Noncurrent Liab ilities increased by $ 1 6 .6 million due to an increase in debt related to the construction of the new University Center and the Living Learning Complex , as well as an increase in the Other Post Employment Benefits ( OPEB ) liability of $ 3 million. The $3 7 . 4 m illion increase in Invested in Capital Assets Net of Related Debt is a result of the renovation of the Downtown Law School ($ 21.5 million), the construction of the University Center ($ 13 million funded locally) , the Campus Wireless U pgrade project ($1.4 mi llion) and the South Campus Electric and Gas Infrastructure Re placement project ($1. 8 million). The decrease in Restricted - Expendable Net Assets is primarily due to the retirement of the Wilson Hotel debt . This debt was funded with a restricted gift. Un restricted Net Assets increased by $1 1.5 million primarily due to spending reductions implemented to offset the cut in State Appropriations including cost - cutting measures, limiting hiring and restructuring, as well as the availability of f ederal ARRA fund s and THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2010 5 the spending time frame required for these funds. Additionally, the University benefited from a two - month health insura nce premium holiday . Comparison of FY 2010 to FY 2009 Current assets decreased due to a $2.6 million decrease in net pledges receivable resulting from a $1.2 million increase in the allowan ce for uncollectable pledges as well as collections on existing pledges exceeding the receipt of new pledges . These declines are all believed to be related to the gene rally poor economic environment. The decrease is partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from gi fts received at fiscal year end. Current liabilities increased due to a higher level of accounts payable principally related to Athletic Department commitments. Noncurrent liabilities decreased due to loan payments made. Restricted - expendable net assets decreased principally due to expenditures and transfers to permanently restricted. Unrestricted net assets increased principally due to restricted endowment net assets associated with Board - designated endowment funds being reclassified to unrestricted net assets as a result of implementation of FAS 117 - 1, Endowments of Not - for - Profit Organizations: Net Asset Classification of Funds Subject to an Enacted Version of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, and Enhanced Disclosures for All E ndowment Funds. Many of the unrestricted net assets have been designated for specific purposes such as , repairs and replacement of equipment, future debt service, capital projects, and student loans. The following graph shows the allocations : THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2010 6 Allocation of Net Assets The University Comparison of FY 20 10 to FY 200 9 The increase in Working Capital Designated Net Assets of $ 3.2 million is primarily relat ed to increases in receivables from the University of Memphis Foundation (Tiger Scholarship Fund) for the support of Athletics and the Federal ARRA S tate F iscal Stabilization F unds (SFSF) drawdown receivable at June 30, 2010 . The Undesignated Net Assets decreased due to funding for Plant Construction for deferred maintenance pr ojects . The increase in the Plant Constr uction Net Assets represents funding for deferred maintenance projects. This one - time funding is available as a result of cost cutting measures, limited hiring and restructuring implemented in response to State bud get cuts. Additional funds resulted from a state - wide two - month health insurance premium holiday as well as access to Federal ARRA funds, coupled with the priority placed on spending these funds to comply with federal spending requirements. The Statemen t of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets presents the operating results of the University , as well as the nonoperating revenues and expenses. Annual state appropriations, while budg eted for operations, are considered non - operating revenues according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America . 18% 1% 3% 1% 47% 23% 7% 2010 Working Capital Encumbrance Designated Fees Auxiliaries Plant Construction Renewal and Replacement Undesignated 16% 1% 3% 1% 35% 23% 21% 2009 THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2010 7 Comparison of FY 2010 to FY 2009 Net tuition and fees increased by $9 million as a result of a 7 % increase in student fees as well as increased enrollment. State appropriations decreased $9 million as a result of a n 8 % cut in state appropriations . Base State appropriation actually decreased by 15% , however this reduction was offset by a special one - time appropriation (Maintenance of Effort). The decrease in investment income is due to lower market yields . Other nonoperatin g revenues include a $ 1 2.5 million increase in Pell Grants , a $2 million increase in Tennessee HOPE Scholarships , and $1 7 . 1 million in Federal ARRA State Fiscal Stabilization Funds . Capital appropriations decrease d by $ 7.5 million primarily due to State a ppropriated construction funding for the D owntown Law School in FY 2009 . The renovation of the Downtown Law School was completed in FY 2010. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 2010 8 Capital g rants and g ifts increased as the result of a $5.3 million payment by the Foundation to the United States P ostal Service for the Downtown Law School buil ding and the capitalization of the related easement for $1.2 million . Comparison of FY 2010 to FY 2009 The decrease in gifts and contributions is believed to be principally due to general economic conditions. The increase in operating expenses is principally due to an increase in construction and special projects. T he increase in investment income is principally due to improved financial markets. The decrease in other revenues, expenses, gains or losses is principally due to a reclassification of Restricted Endowment Net Assets associated with Board - designated endowm ent funds to Unrestricted Net Assets. This reclassification was a result of implementation of FAS 117 - 1, Endowments of Not - for - Profit Organizations: Net Asset Classification of Funds Subject to an Enacted Version of the Uniform Prudent Management of Insti tutional Funds Act, and Enhanced Disclosures for All Endowment Funds.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies REPORTING ENTITY The University is a part of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee (Tennessee Board of Regents). This system is a component unit of the State of Tennessee because the state appoints a the Tennessee Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The financial statements present only that portion of the Ten attributable to the transactions of The University of Memphis . The University of Memphis Foundation is considered a component unit of the U nivers ity. Although the University does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the F oundation, the majority of resource s, or income thereon, that the F oundation holds and invests are restricted to th e activities of the U niversity by the donors. Because these re stricted resources held by the F oundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the U niv ersity , the F oundation is considered a component unit of the University and is discretely presented in the U niversit s financial statements. See Note 20 for more detailed information about the component unit and how to obtain the report. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The U accepted in the United States of America applicable to governmental colleges and universities engaged in business - type activities as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). BASIS OF ACCOUNTING For financial statement purposes, the U niversity is considered a special - purpose government engaged only in b usiness - type activities. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability i s incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met. All significant interfund transactions have been eliminated. Private - sector standards of accounting and financial reporting issued prior to December 1, 1989, generally are followed to the extent that those standards do not conflict with or contradict guidance of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). T he University has the option of following private - sector guidance issued subsequent to November 30, 1989, subject to the above limitation. The U niversity has elected not to follow private - sector guidance issued subsequent to November 30, 1989. Amounts re ported as operating revenues include: 1) tuition and fees, net of waivers and discounts, 2) certain federal, state, local and private grants and contracts, 3) sales and services of auxiliary enterprises, and 4) other sources of revenue. Operating expenses for the University include: 1) salaries and wages, 2) employee benefits, 3) scholarships and fellowships, 4) depreciation, and 5) utilities, supplies, and other services. All other activity is nonoperating in nature. This activity includes: 1) state a ppropriations for operations, 2) investment income, 3) bond issuance costs, 4) interest on capital asset - related debt, and 5) gifts and non - exchange transactions .

THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 10 29 Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation Funded Status and Funding Progress . The funded status of the plan as of June 30, 20 10 , was as follows: Actuarial valuations involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of events far into the future, and actuarially determined amounts are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared to past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as R equired S upplementary I nformation following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions . Calculations are based on the types of benefits provided under the terms of the substantive plan at the time of each valuation and on the pattern of sharing of costs between the employer and plan members to that point . Actuarial calculations reflect a long - term perspective. Consistent with that perspective, actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce short - term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial val ue of assets. In the July 1, 2009, actuarial valuation, the Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 4.5% investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses) and an annual healthcare cost trend rat e of 6% initially, increased to 10% in the second year and then reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5% in fiscal year 2021. All rates include a 3% inflation assumption. The unfunded actuarial accrued liability is being amortized as a level perc entage of payroll on a closed basis over a 30 year period beginning with July 1, 2007.

These funds are held in trust by the state and are not included in these financial statements. 1 4 . Insurance - Related Activities It is the policy of the state not to purchase commercial ins urance for the risks of losses for general liability, it is more economical to manage these risks internally and set aside assets for claim settleme nt in its internal service fund, the Risk Management Fund. The state purchases commercial insurance for real property, flood, The amounts of settlement s have not exceeded insurance coverage for each of the three past fiscal years. The Risk Management Fund is also responsible for claims for damages to state owned property up to the amount of the property insurance aggregate deductible amount. The insura nce policy deductibles vary from $25,000 per occurrence, depending on the type of coverage, to an aggregate of $5 million. The University participates in the Risk Management Fund. The fund allocates the cost of providing claims servicing and claims payment by charging a premium to the University based on a percentage of the expected loss costs, which include both experience an d exposures. This charge considers recent trends in actual claims experience of the state as a whole. An actuarial valuation is performed as of fiscal year - end to determine the fund liability and premium allocation. Information regarding the determinati on of the claims liabilities and the changes in the balances of the claims liabilities for the years ended June 30, 20 10 , and June 30, 200 9 , are presented in the Tennessee Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The CAFR is at . Since the University participates in the Risk Management Fund, it is subject to the liability limitations under the provisions of the Tennessee Claims Commission Act, Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 9 - 8 - 101 et seq.

At June 30, 20 10 , the scheduled coverage for the University was $ 1,213,223,300 for buildings and $ 306,755,200 for contents. The state has also set aside assets in the Employee Group Insurance Fund, an internal service fund, to provide a program of health insurance coverage for the employees of the state with the risk retained by the state. The University participates in the Employee Group Insurance Fund. The fund allocates the cost of providing claims servicing and claims paym ent by charging a premium to the University based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims , including the costs of claims that have been reported but not settled and of claims that have been incurred but not reported. Employees and providers have 13 mo nths to file medical claims. 1 5 . Commitments and Contingencies Sick Leave - The University records the cost of sick leave when paid. Generally, since sick leave (earned one day per month with unlimited accumulation) is paid only when an employee dies or is absent because of illness, injury, or related family death, there is no liability for si ck leave at June 30.

Component Unit(s) The University of Memphis Foundation ( Foundation ) is a legally separate, 501 (c) (3) tax - exempt organization supporting the University of Memphis . The Foundation ac cep ts and manages private support to the University of Memphis to supplement the reso urces that are available to the University in support of its programs. The approximately 40 - member board of the Foundation is self - perpetuating and consists of graduates and friends of the University . Although the University does not control the timing o r amount of receipts from the Foundation, all resources, or income thereon, that the Foundation holds and invests are restricted to support of the various activities , programs and endeavors of the University by the donors. Because these restricted resource s held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the University , the Foundation is considered a component unit of the University and is discretely presented in the financial statements. During the year ended June 30, 20 10 , the Foundation made expenditures of $ 2 1,049,192 to or on behalf of the University for both restricted and unrestricted purposes. Complete financial statements for the Foundation can be obtained from the Managing Director, University of Memphis Foundatio n, 635 Normal Street, Memphis, Tennessee, 38152 - 3750 . The Foundation is a nonprofit organization that reports under FASB standards, including FASB Statement No. 117, Financial Reporting for Not - for - Profit Organizations. As such, certain revenue recogniti on criteria and presentation features are different from GASB revenue recognition criteria and presentation features. With the exception of necessary presentation adjustments, no modifications have been made to e financial report for these differences. Fair Value Measurements . The F oundation reports certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value has been determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date (Level 1), inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability (Level 2), or significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Th e following table categorizes the recurring fair value measurements for assets and liabilities at June 30, 20 10 : THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 10 33 The following table reconciles beginning and ending balance of all assets/liabilities valued using Level 3 inputs: All gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, have been reported on the Statement of Reve nues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets as investment income. Of this total, $ 6,101,075 is attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at June 30, 20 10 . Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposit accounts . FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 of the funds, leaving an uninsured bank balance at June 30, 2010, of $948,678. Investments Investments are recorded on the date of acquisition and are stated at market value. Unrealized gains and losses are determined by the difference between market values at the beginning and end of the year. Investment securities held at year - end were as follows: Alternative Investments - The F oundation has certain limited partnership investments and certain other investments that are classified for fair value measurement purposes as Level 3 . The estimated fair value of these investment s is $ 24,611,952 at June 30, 20 10 . The F oundation believ es that the carrying amount of s uch alternative investments is a reasonable estimate of fair value as of June 30, 20 10 . Because these investments are not readily marketable, the estimated value is subject to uncertainty and, therefore, may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and such differences could be material. These investments are made in accordance with the F oundation provid es for the allocation of funds to various asset classes in order to achieve an appropriate level of diversification. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 10 34 Pledges Receivable - Pledges receivable are summarized below net of the allowance for doubtful accounts: E ndowment Funds - T he University of Memphis 3 8 0 individual funds established for a variety of purposes. Its endowment includes both donor - restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as an endowment . As required by GAAP, net assets associated with endowment fun ds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor - imposed restrictions. Interpretation of Relevant Law The Board of Trustees of the University of Memp his Foundation has interpreted the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (the Act) as adopted by Tennessee as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor - restricted endowment funds abse nt explicit donor stipulations to the contrary . As a result of this interpretation, the Foundation classifies as permanently restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment funds , (b) the original value of subseque nt gifts to the permanent endowment funds , and (c) any donor specified accumulations to the permanent endowment funds made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument. The remaining portion of the donor - restricted endowment fu nd that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the F oundation in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by the Act. In accordance with the Act, the F oundation considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor - restricted endowment funds: 1. The duration and preservation of the fund 2. The purposes of the foundation and the endowment fund 3. General economic conditions 4. The possible effect of inflation or deflation 5. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 6. Other resources of the foundation 7. The investment policies of the foundation THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 10 35 Return Objectives and Risk Parameters The F oundation has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowme nt funds while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor - restricted funds that the organization must hold in perpetuity or for a donor - specified period(s) as well as board - designated f unds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce long - term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk. The F oundation funds is a total return over a market cycle of at least 5% over the inflation rate . A market cycle shall generally be considered to be a three to five year period. Actual returns in any given year may vary from this amount. Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives To satisfy its long - term rate - of - return objectives, the F oundation relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and d ividends). The F oundation targets a diversified asset allocation that places a greater emphasis on equity - based investments to achieve its long - term return objectives within prudent risk restraints. Spending Policy and How the Investment Objectives Rel ate The F oundation has a policy of budgeting ( appropriating ) for expenditure each year a percentage of its - end one year prece e ding the fiscal year in which the expe nditure is planned . For fiscal year 2010 this percentage was five percent (5%). In establishing this policy, the Foundation considered the long - term expected return on its endowment funds . Accordingly, over the long - term, the F oundation expects the curre nt spending policy to allow for endowment grow th . This is consistent with the F power of the endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through n ew gifts and investment return.
