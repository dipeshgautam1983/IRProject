Memphis and Shelby County contributed $350,000 and a site of approximately eighty acres near what was then the eastern edge of the city. On September 15, 1912, West Tennessee State Normal School opened. In 1925, the institution became a senior college and the name was changed to West Tennessee State Teachers' College. The liberal arts curriculum was enlarged in 1941 and the school became Memphis State College. The undergraduate program was reorganized into three schools in 1951, and a graduate school was added. On July 1, 1957, by action of the Tennessee legislature, the institution was designated Memphis State University. Reflecting the institution's growing emphasis on research and graduate education and its increasing role in the community, the institution was renamed The University of Memphis on July 1, 1994. Higher Education in TennesseeThe Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), created in 1967 by act of the Tennessee General Assembly, is responsible for coordinating and planning all higher education in this state. The commission coordinates two systems of higher 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 1 - Introduction and Organization - The University of 4:13:34 PM]education: the University of Tennessee institutions, governed by the University of Tennessee Board of Trustees, and the state universities, community colleges, technical institutes, and technology centers, governed by the Tennessee Board of Regents. THEC must approve all new academic programs, centers, or campuses; it reviews budgets, performs long-range planning, and generally ensures that a comprehensive system of higher education is developed to meet the needs of the citizens. The Tennessee Board of Regents was created in 1972 by the General Assembly as the governing body of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee. At that time, the member institutions of the System were the state universities and community colleges formerly governed by the State Board of Education. In 1983, the General Assembly transferred the technical institutes and area vocational schools (now called Tennessee Technology Centers) to the System. The composition and powers of the Board are set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated 49-8-201 through 49-8-203. The Board consists of 18 members: 12 lay citizens appointed for six-year terms by the Governor from each congressional district and grand division of the state; one faculty member appointed for a one-year term; one student appointed for a one-year term by the Governor from among the System institutions; and four ex-officio members including the Gover nor, Commissioner of Education, Commissioner of Agriculture, and Executive Director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission. The Board is responsible for setting public direction in postsecondary education. Members serve without compensation and meet at least four times a year in regular session. Called sessions are convened occasionally for special purposes. As a legislative entity, the purpose of the Board is to govern and manage the System. It is empowered to employ the chancellor and define the chancellor's duties, select and employ presidents of the institutions, confer tenure and approve promotion in rank of System faculty; prescribe curricula and requirements for diplomas and degrees, approve the operating and capital budgets of each institution and otherwise set policies for their fiscal affairs, establish policies and regulations regarding the campus life of the institutions, and assume general responsibility for the operations of the institutions while delegating specifically to the presidents the powers and duties necessary and appropriate for the efficient administration of their respective institutions and programs.The other Tennesee Board of Regent institutions with baccalaureate and graduate programs are Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee State University in Nashville, and Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville. University Governance The president is the chief administrative officer of the University with broadly delegated responsibilities for all facets of campus management and operations. The president serves at the pleasure of the Tennessee Board of Regents and reports to the Board through the chancel lor, and is the official medium of communication between the campus community and the chancellor. The provost and the vice presidents form an advisory group to the president. The provost is the chief academic officer of the University. Reporting to the president, he has comprehensive responsibility for developing and implementing academic 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 1 - Introduction and Organization - The University of 4:13:34 PM]policies and priorities, and has responsibility for ensuring that the Universitys teaching, research, and service missions are successfully implemented. He works closely with the deans and directors of the academic units to insure that the University recruits and retains high quality faculty who, in turn, offer optimal student experiences. Other members of the executive team include the vice presidents for Advancement; Business and Finance; Student Affairs; Information Technology; and Communications, Public Relations, and Marketing; and the Athletic Director. Thepresident is also assisted and advised by the Faculty and Staff Senates.

Approved by the Provost Standing Committee: Space Policy Council SPACE POLICY COUNCIL Introduction The Universitys facilities are a resource that must be viewed from a comprehensive institutional perspective. In order to address changing programmatic space needs, the University must develop effective methods to analyze and evaluate space requests and allocate facility resources. This will be accomplished through the establishment of a University Space Policy Council through the Office of the Provost. The President will appoint members to the Space Policy Council on an annual basis. The Chair and Vice Chair shall be appointed by the President from among the voting members. Composition Representative from the Office of the President Representative from the Provost Office Representative from Business and Finance Representative from Advancement and MarketingRepresentative from Information Technology Representative from Student Affairs Representative from Communications, Public Relations & Marketing Representative from Research Office Dean of Arts & Sciences Three Deans from colleges other than Arts & Sciences Representative from the Office of the Registrar Representative from the Student Government Association 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 1 - Introduction and Organization - The University of 4:13:34 PM]Chair and Co-Chair of the Facilities and Services Committee Faculty Senate representative Staff Senate representative Director for Space Planning and Utilization , ex-officio Space Analyst for Space Planning and Utilization (ex-officio, recording secretary) Charge The Space Policy Council is a decision-making body regarding space issues. As such, it will provide a forum for the discussion and approval of individual space requests, campus-wide space plans, plans for new space, space utilization reports, policies and procedures regulating the use of facilities, and other critical space planning issues that require policy level deliberation. A few decisions are of such magnitude that deliberation and support from the Executive Officers of the University are needed for a high probability of successful implementation. In such circumstances, the Council may be called upon to provide an analysis of options and a recommendation for consideration, including legal, environmental, and budgetary issues. The Council Chair and Vice Chair, in consultation with the Director for Space Planning and Utilization, will work with the Provost to determine if a space issue has potential policy ramifications and thus should be placed on the agenda for a regular Council meeting. Agenda items should be established prior to the meeting date so that materials for discussion can be made available to Council members in advance. The Chair and Vice Chair will preside over regular Council meetings and will coordinate with the Provost to ensure that activities are aligned in such a way as to be most beneficial to the decision-making process and a productive operational environment.The Council will be responsible for obtaining input from various sources as appropriate and may create advisory sub-committees to examine and recommend decisions about specific issues. However, the Council will consult with the Provost before delegating specifically stated decision-making authority, such as the prioritization of requested modifications. NOTE: The Council will not be responsible for event scheduling, assignment of space for events, or assignment of space for classes. However changes in classroom usage to something other than a classroom category requires the approval of the Council. Guidelines for Council Operation The Space Policy Council consists of members representing constituencies from all segments of the University. Members will simultaneously represent both the overall University and their constituency area. Members should strive to cultivate good communication links to solicit input and to provide feedback to constituencies regarding the rationale leading to decisions, standards, or policies. Each member should use his or her foremost judgment, based upon an understanding of what constitutes the best overall solution for the institution as a whole. Whenrecommendations have been reached members need to assume responsibility, wherever possible, to assure outcomes that contribute to the mission, goals, and best 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 1 - Introduction and Organization - The University of 4:13:34 PM]interest of the University. As a policy-oriented body, the Councils primary focus should be on the following points: (1) to assure that the space process is functioning productively; (2) to define and prioritize parameters and processes to be utilized in operational decision-making, (3) to define and approve policies and procedures, including detailed forms and instructions for requesting space use changes, (4) to ensure that recommendations from the advisory sub-committees have appropriately considered options, costs, and benefits and determine if additional analysis should be conducted; and (5) in a few circumstances where a decision between alternatives has policy or program implications, to weigh the competing options based on the best interests of the institution as a whole and recommend to the Provost which option to implement. Any Executive Officer of the University may request the Provost to review such a recommendation if it has policy or operational impacts upon his/her administrative unit.Role of the Director for Space Planning and Utilization The Director for Space Planning and Utilization will process routine space assignments that do not require Council action. Examples of these assignments are: Reassignment of offices within a department/unit due to turnover of employees. Temporary assignments to allow construction or space renovations to occur. Allocation of space that is unsuitable for occupation or use other than temporary storage.The Director will also work with the University faculty and staff to acquire input on space issues, requests, proposals, and to provide technical assistance and guidance to the Council. As an ex-officio, non-voting, member the Director for Space Planning and Utilization will: 1. Develop and maintain long-range space utilization plans for all University facilities with input from the Council. 2. Develop and recommend space assignment policies and procedures, with input from the Council, for the University in accordance with THEC standards. 3. Support the Councils efforts to consider requests and recommend changes in space utilization within existing buildings; prepare data analysis reports and impact reports as required for inclusion with Council recommendations. 4. Support the Councils efforts to recommend the assignment of space within new buildings or buildings that have been vacant and are being reoccupied. 5. Review the leasing to non-University occupants of any real property assigned to the University, including land, buildings, and other improvements. 6. Review the leasing by the University of any non-University real property, including land, buildings, and other improvements. Agenda items should be submitted prior to the meeting date so that materials for 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 1 - Introduction and Organization - The University of 4:13:34 PM]discussion can be made available to Council members in advance. The chair and vice chair will review requests with the Provost to set the agenda for the Council meetings and determine what additional information is needed to ensure the meeting is productive.Meetings Meetings will be held monthly, or as necessary. Annual Report Due on or before July 15 and shall contain at least the following information: log of requests received with note of disposition, such record to be open to the University community; assignments recommended by the Committee; unresolved space requests; an outline of unresolved issues which might be considered, discussed, and acted upon during the following year; a report on contributions of Committee members; and any recommendations for membership on the following years Committee. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles - The University of 4:13:35 PM]2011 Faculty Handbook Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles ContentsFaculty Roles Academic Freedom Professional Ethics and Misconduct in Research American Association of University Professors Department Chairs Chairs of Excellence Faculty Administrators Faculty Ombudsperson Faculty Grievance Committee Graduate Faculty Status Faculty Senate Faculty Senate Constitution, Special Rules of Order and Standing Rules Faculty Roles Academic Freedom The University of Memphis endorses the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the American Association of University Professors, as revised and refined since 1940, and also the Statement on Professional Ethics of the same organization, insofar as these are not limited by state law or the policies of the Tennessee Board of Regents of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee. The University recognizes the principle of academic freedom, and accordingly: Faculty members are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing materialsrelevant to the course. Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to adequate performance of their other academic duties; but all research, including research for pecuniary gain, must be performed in an ethical manner and in compliance with all applicable policies and standards in the discipline and must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the University. See also U of M Policy No. 1606. Faculty members are citizens, members of a learned profession, and officers of an educa tional institution. When faculty members speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As persons of learning and as educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge the profession and the institution by their utterances. Hence, faculty members should at all times strive to be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they do not speak for the institution. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles - The University of 4:13:35 PM] Academic freedom is essential to fulfilling the ultimate objectives of the University of Memphis. The free search for and exposition of truth, applies to both teaching and research. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth, and academic freedom in teaching is fundamental to the protection of the rights of the faculty member in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning. Implicit in the principle of academic freedom are the corollary responsibilities of the faculty who enjoy that freedom. Incompetence, indolence, intellectual dishonesty, serious moral dereliction, arbitrary and capricious disregard of standards of professional conduct, these and other grounds may constitute adequate cause for dismissal or other disciplinary sanctions against faculty members subject to the provisions of the policy on academic tenure. The right to academic freedom imposes upon the faculty an equal obligation to take appropriate professional action against faculty members who are derelict in discharging their professional responsibilities. Thus, academic freedom and academic responsibility are interdependent, and academic tenure is adopted as a means to protect the former while promoting the latter. While academic tenure is essential for the protection of academic freedom, all faculty members, tenured or non-tenured, have an equal right to academic freedom and bear the same academic responsibilities implicit in that freedom. Professional Ethics and Misconduct in Research Unethical conduct in teaching, research, scholarship, or service constitutes a serious breach of academic integrity that undermines the University's scholarly and educational purpose. If substantiated, such misconduct may be cause for disciplinary action, including termination for adequate cause subject to the provisions of the University's policy and procedure on aca demic tenure. Unethical conduct includes, but is not limited to, the fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious unethical or illegal deviations from accepted practices within a discipline. Further information regarding this issue may be found in the University's policy and procedure on professional ethics/misconduct in research. American Association of University Professors Founded in 1915, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is dedicated to facili tating a more effective cooperation among teachers and research scholars in universities, colleges, and professional schools; to promoting the interests of higher education and research; and in general to increasing the usefulness and advancing the standards, ideals, and welfare of the profession. AAUP works to defend academic freedom and tenure, advocates collegial governance, and develops policies ensuring due process. More about AAUP is available on the web at Chairs Outstanding faculty are appointed to administer the University's academic departments in various disciplines and fields. Faculty holding appointments as chairs are considered to be academic leaders, and as such, often will be consulted by the provost and their deans regarding development and implementation of academic policy. Although chairs report to the deans of their colleges, the provost may consult them in many matters concerning academic governance. A faculty member appointed to a chair's position will also hold a tenure-track appointment in one of the academic departments at the university. Tenure-track appointments are subject to the same rules and conditions applicable to all tenure-track appointments. Following the award of tenure, faculty members holding an 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles - The University of 4:13:35 PM]appointment as a chair remain subject to the same rules and conditions applicable to all tenured appointments. Faculty holding appointments as chairs may receive administrative salary supplements and other forms of fiscal and staff support for their research and/or other scholarly activity. When possible, faculty holding chairs are expected to continue to teach, maintain active research programs and provide service to the University and to the community. chairs will be evaluated annually by the dean of their college or school and by all tenured, tenure-track and untenured faculty members within their departments. Every five to seven years, the dean will conduct a review of each chair holder. Failure to continue to perform at a high level of administrative excellence could lead to removal from the chair, and the loss of the associated benefits accruing to the faculty member in his or her status as a chair holder. The department chair occupies one of the most complex and demanding positions in the University, with widespread responsibilities to faculty members, students, and administrative officers. The position is filled by local administrative appointment following a search and selection process that involves the faculty in the recommendation of qualified candidates. University administrators who have responsibility for appointing department chairs should ensure that such appointments are judged acceptable by the majority of the faculty in a department, except under unusual circumstances. The chair's performance is evaluated regularly by faculty members in the department and by the dean at least annually; service in the position is at the discretion of the dean. Some of the chair's specific administrative responsibilities include: Organizing the department in such a way that the total program will be served effectivelyrnDeveloping a set of department policies, supplementary to and consistent with those of the college and Universityrn Providing leadership in departmental planningrn Assisting in developing a continuing education programrn Developing and administering the department's budgetrn Supervising the department's secretarial and support staffrn Preparing class schedules and teaching assignmentsrn Supervising and managing the physical facilities under the department's jurisdictionrnPromoting positive interpersonal relationsrn Serving as a link between the department and the university administration rnThe chair's faculty responsibilities include: rnrnRecruiting capable faculty members (in concerted effort with the faculty and with the concurrence of administrative officers)rn Encouraging and rewarding excellence in teaching, research and creative endeavors, and servicern Assisting and encouraging faculty in securing outside funding for researchrn Evaluating faculty performance annuallyrn Recommending faculty members for tenure, promotion, salary adjustments, 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles - The University of 4:13:35 PM]continuing education assignments, and graduate faculty memberships rn Serving as a link between faculty and University administration rnThe chair's student responsibilities include: rnrnEstablishing an effective advising systemrn Ensuring that students meet degree requirementsrn Administering a graduate assistantship programrn Conferring with students about policies and practices of the department, the college, and the universityrn Assisting students in solving problems relating to academic mattersrn Assisting in student recruitment Chairs of Excellence Role of the Chair of Excellence Outstanding faculty are appointed to fill the University's endowed Chairs of Excellence in various disciplines and fields. Faculty holding appointments as Chairs of Excellence are considered to be academic leaders, and as such, often will be consulted by the Provost and their Deans regarding development and implementation of academic policy. Although Chairs of Excellence report to the Chair of their home department regarding departmental matters, they often interact directly with the Deans and the Provost in many matters concerning academic governance. A faculty member appointed to a Chair of Excellence will also hold a tenure-track appointment in the faculty member's home department or academic unit. The tenure- track appointment is subject to the same rules and conditions applicable to all tenure- track appointments. Following the award of tenure, faculty members holding an appointment as a Chair of Excellence remain subject to the same rules and conditions applicable to all tenured appointments. Faculty holding appointments as Chairs of Excellence may receive salary supplements and various forms of fiscal and staff support for their research and/or other scholarly activity. Faculty holding Chairs of Excellence are expected to continue to perform at the same level of research and/or scholarly excellence that led to their appointment in a Chair of Excellence. Faculty members holding Chairs of Excellence will be evaluated annually by their department chair or the head of their academic unit. In addition to the annual review, the Provost will form a committee to conduct a more comprehensive review of the Chair's work every seven (7) years. The committee will include the Provost, Dean and Department Chair (or in cases where there is no departmental unit, the person who conducts the chair's annual evaluation). Documents submitted for review should include the Chair's original contract, copies of annual performance evaluations, an updated curriculum vitae, and a brief status report. This report should summarize the Chair's professional work over the previous seven years in light of expectations stipulated in the contract, any revisions which had been made in those plans over the intervening years, and the directions the Chair plans to take over the upcoming years in his/her professional work. Each member of the committee should review the documents submitted by the Chair 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles - The University of 4:13:35 PM]individually and then meet as a group with the Chair to conduct the planning and review process. Once the review is completed, the Provost will have responsibility for making the final assessment of the prior performance and future plans of the Chairbased upon his/her consultation with the other committee members. Failure to continue to perform at a high level of research and scholarly excellence could lead to removal from a Chair of Excellence, and the loss of the associated benefits accruing to the faculty member in his or her status as a Chair holder. Faculty Administrators Because of their experience in academics, faculty administrators have critical management positions at the University of Memphis. Their administrative responsibilities, however, do not preclude them from participating in the teaching, scholarship/research, and outreach/service activities of their departments. Rather, they are strongly encouraged to participate in departmental responsibilities as long as these responsibilities are compatible with their administrative duties. Faculty Ombudsperson The University of Memphis Faculty Ombudsperson is an independent, confidential and impartial resource available to the faculty to facilitate cooperation and consensus through education and mediation. The Ombudsperson is a designated neutral or impartial dispute resolution practitioner whose major function is to provide confidential and informal assistance to all faculty of the institution. Serving as a designated neutral, the Ombudsperson is neither an advocate for any individual nor the organization, but rather, serves as an advocate for fairness who acts as a source of information and referral, aids in answering questions, and assists in the resolution of concerns and critical situations. More specifically, the Ombudsperson engenders awareness and skill development in the areas of conflict resolution, communication, team building and civility. In a neutral and impartial role, the Ombudsperson assists all tenured, tenure-track, clinical, research, one-year and part-time instructors and teaching assistants to resolve complaints with the goal of promoting alternatives to adversarial processes. The Ombudsperson receives and seeks to resolve complaints, explains relevant policies and procedures, conducts or directs research and fact- finding, makes referrals to appropriate campus and community resources, makes recommendations for change, attempts to open avenues of communication among parties, and mediates between conflicting parties. As needed, the Ombudsperson makes recommendations to the Provost concerning policy and/or procedural changes that arise as a result of conflicts that have occurred. The Ombudsperson maintains collaborative relationships with other University offices (e.g., Academic Affairs, Human Resources, Affirmative Action, Student Affairs). However, when legal and/or disciplinary issues arise, the Ombudsperson refers the case to the appropriate unit of the University. Moreover, the ombudspersons activities are restricted to the faculty and to teaching assistants; staff and student conflicts should be directed to the Department of Human Resources and the Office of Student Affairs respectively. The Ombudsperson reports to the Provost. Selection and Term: The Provost sends an All Faculty email inviting faculty nominations for the position of Faculty Ombudsperson. The Faculty Srnate will appoint a committee that will review the applications and identify acceptable candidates to the Provost. The Provost shall not select a candidate deemed 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles - The University of 4:13:35 PM]unacceptable to the Senate committee. However, the Provost reserves the right to re- open the search if the Provost does not find an acceptable candidate from those forwarded by the committee. This process assures that no candidate would be named who is not at least acceptable to both the Senate committee and the Provost. The Faculty Ombudsperson serves a one year, renewable term. The Faculty Ombudsperson will annually submit a summary report to the Provost, which will be shared with the Faculty Sneate. Contact information for the Faculty Ombudsperson can be found at Faculty Grievance CommitteeThe Faculty Grievance Committee, consisting of nine (9) faculty members appointed by the Faculty Senate, provides an avenue of appeal for faculty who feel mistreated in their relationship(s) with other faculty members or with administrators of the University of Memphis. In addition, the Grievance Committee provides a source of appeal for tenured faculty who feel they have been unfairly treated during annual evaluations. The Faculty Grievance Committee provides advice to faculty members bringing a grievance, decides to accept or reject submitted grievances, investigates grievances, mediates when called upon, and makes recommendations to the president of the university. In addition, the Grievance Committee provides a source of appeal for faculty regarding their evaluations only based on claims of violation of academic freedom or failure to follow the proper procedures in conducting the annual evaluation. Matters regarding the substance of the evaluation are not subject to appeal.Graduate Faculty Status The University bestows the designation graduate faculty on individual faculty members following review of their credentials and recommendation by their colleagues. Applicants for graduate faculty status must show evidence of scholarly productivity. Once conferred, graduate faculty must submit evidence of continued scholarly productivity every five years in order to retain the status. The graduate faculty support graduate programs by chairing and serving on graduate student committees, planning and designating graduate instructional programs, supervising graduate student research, participating in the design and review of policies governing graduate affairs, and discharging other duties critical to maintaining an effective graduate school. The University of Memphis maintains four levels of graduate faculty: full, associate, adjunct, and affiliate. Only full graduate faculty members may chair doctoral committees. Only one adjunct or affiliate graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member on a master's or doctoral committee. Graduate faculty membership is required to teach graduate only (7000, 8000 level) courses and seminars. A request from the appropriate department chair must be approved by the Vice Provost for Graduate Programs for an exception to this rule. Information on the requirements for graduate faculty status and the application form are available through the Graduate School's website at 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 2 - Academic Freedom and Faculty Roles - The University of 4:13:35 PM]Faculty Senate The Faculty Senate is composed of elected faculty members. Administrators participate as observers by invitation. The Senate's Constitution defines its purpose as follows:serve as the primary vehicle of faculty participation in the establishment ofUniversity policies; evaluate and make recommendations on policy in academic and closely related areas that touch on academic matters; approve graduation and general education curriculum requirements; evaluate and make recommendations on University-wide minimum criteria for faculty appointment, promotion, and tenure; evaluate and make recommendations on policies associated with conditions of employment;evaluate and make recommendations on policies for the academic use and operation of various academic support functions including the University Library and Computer Services, the University calendar and other functions that directly affect academic matters; make recommendations on issues related to academic matters that are not specifically academic in nature; have responsibility for the maintenance of academic freedom and responsibility at the University; be the forum for the formulation of faculty opinion; review and approve the Faculty Handbook of The University of Memphis.

The university also posts all full-time faculty openings on the web at workforum.memphis.edu. Those interested in an open faculty position at the University of Memphis should electronically submit appropriate materials prior to the stated deadline. Application materials are reviewed by the appropriate departmental faculty. Applicants for faculty positions who are invited to the campus usually will meet with faculty members, chairs, deans, vice presidents, or others so that all parties may gain as much information and understanding as possible. Although information is shared and questions answered, the university cannot be committed in any way during these interviews. Note: Tenn. Code Annotated 49-5-406 requires applicants for faculty positions to disclose any prior criminal record and/or prior dismissals from employment for cause. Failure to comply with this law may result in fine, dismissal, or both. Faculty Hiring Faculty appointments, and all conditions related to them, are made only by the university president, in writing, subject to appropriate approvals and policies of the Tennessee Board of Regents. All non-tenured faculty members are employed on an annual basis and are required to sign an employment agreement for each year of employment. Notice of any salary adjustments are sent to members of the faculty after the budget for the ensuing year is approved by the Tennessee Board of Regents. Types of Appointments The following constitute the types of faculty positions that are recognized at the University of Memphis. rn Temporary Appointments rn Temporary appointments ordinarily are made for instructors, adjunct or part-time faculty, faculty employed to replace regular faculty on leave of absence, and faculty employed on grants or for projects funded by non-appropriated funds. Temporary appointments may be made for faculty employed with state appropriated funds where the permanent and continued need for the position is not yet fully established, provided the appointment does not exceed three academic years. A temporary faculty position held by the same individual for three successive years must be advertised and must be the subject of a full search before the position may be filled for the next academic year. rn Faculty appointed in temporary positions for terms of more than six months are eligible for University employment benefits. All temporary appointments may be terminated in conformance with the terms of the employment agreement. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 3 - Faculty Personnel Policies - The University of 4:13:35 PM]rnTenure-Track Appointments rn Tenure track appointments are appointments for full time faculty positions. Tenure track faculty are employed for a probationary period prior to consideration for tenure. Probationary appointments generally may not exceed a period of six years when tenure and promotion to associate professor would normally be granted. Extension of the probationary period will be considered only in conformance with the subsection of this Handbook entitled Extension of Probationary Period. Applications for early tenureand promotion to associate professor may be made under special circumstances if recommended by the president and the chancellor and approved by the Tennessee Board of Regents. rn Tenure track appointments are subject to annual renewal by the university. Tenure- track appointments do not create or convey any right to permanent or continuous employment, nor do they create any manner of legal right, interest, or expectancy of renewal or any other type of appointment. For additional information regarding tenure- track appointments, see the Handbook chapter entitled Tenure and Promotion. rnTenure Appointments rn Tenure appointments are appointments of full time faculty who have been awarded tenure by the Tennessee Board of Regents upon recommendation of the University's president. Tenure appointments include the assurance of continued employment during the academic year, subject to expiration, relinquishment, or termination of tenure for reasons discussed in the section of this Handbook entitled Expiration, Relinquishment, and Termination of Tenure. Tenure does not guarantee a specified salary, position, or summer session employment.

The absence of teaching excellence and superior contribution to student development or the absence of scholarly or creative activity may prevent advancement to full professor. Since there is no higher rank, promotion to professor is taken with great care and requires a level of achievement substantively beyond that required for associate professor. This rank is not a reward for long service; rather it is recognition of superior achievement within the discipline with every expectation of continuing contribution to the university and the larger academic community. Note: Please see section entitled "Terminal Degrees" for additional information concerning this requirement and any exceptions that may be requested. Terminal DegreesThe Tennessee Board of Regents has responsibility for establishing terminal degree designations for each discipline based upon national standards. The university, however, has the opportunity to request that the Board waive this requirement when it successfully documents that the candidate has exceptional credentials. The university requires all applicants for tenure-, clinical-, or research-track positions to have terminal degrees in their disciplines and to show proof of such credentials before they are hired. Exceptions may be made to this policy under the following circumstances. Candidates may have exceptional credentials that warrant solicitation of a waiver of the terminal degree requirement. Such waivers should be requested in writing by the department chair and should be accompanied with appropriate documentation. The request should be submitted to the dean, provost and president before being forwarded to the Tennessee Board of Regents for final disposition. Candidates may have completed all of the requirements for the terminal degree, with the exception of the dissertation or thesis. With appropriate justification, the candidate may be hired with the understanding that degree completion will take place no more than one year from the date of hire. The candidate will be required to show proof of the degree at that time. Moreover, the initial rate of pay will reflect the candidate's degree status, and will be adjusted accordingly when he/she shows proof of degree receipt. The tenure clock will not begin until the candidate has earned his/her terminal degree or in accordance with criteria set forth in the official letter of offer and employment contract. Language Proficiency As required by the Tennessee Board of Regents, the university assesses the English proficiency of all candidates for faculty positions (including part time and adjunct faculty and graduate teaching assistants) prior to employment in order to insure 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 3 - Faculty Personnel Policies - The University of 4:13:35 PM]adequate proficiency for direct instruction of students. The minimum criteria for evaluation of English proficiency are: (1) an ability to speak and write English clearly, (2) an ability to understand written and spoken English, and (3) an ability to communicate effectively in an academic environment (for example, previous successful employment in an academic institution). The department chair will certify the candidate's English proficiency. The University reserves the right to further assess English language proficiency after a faculty member has been appointed in order to help insure the quality of direct instruction of its students. Personnel Files and Disclosure of Records An official university personnel file is maintained in the Department of Human Resources for all employees except undergraduate student employees. The Office of Faculty Administrative Services also maintains a file for all members of the faculty. Faculty personnel files may include the following documents: professional data (transcripts, vitae, etc.), employment agreements, personnel actions (appointment, tenure, promotion, salary), evaluation documents, letters of recommendation and benefits selection forms. Faculty members or their authorized representatives may review their own files upon request. The University generally limits disclosure of personnel records to those officials in the faculty member's direct line of supervision. Personnel records and information, with certain exceptions, must be disclosed pursuant to a valid request by a citizen of Tennessee in conformance with the Tennessee Public Records Act, Tenn. Code Ann. 10-7- 503, 504. The Act permits the University to withhold only the following information regarding employees and/or members of their family or household: unpublished telephone numbers, bank account information, social security numbers, and drivers license information (unless the employee's position involves operation of a motor vehicle), and certain types of protected information as identified in the Tennessee Public Records Act. The University attempts to notify any affected employee whenever it receives a Public Records Act request for an employee's personnel information, and also provides the name of the party submitting the request. The University's policy and procedure regarding Public Records Act Requests may be accessed at Uof M Procedure UM1616, NepotismTennessee state law prohibits employment of close relatives (i.e., spouses, siblings, children, etc.) within a direct line of supervision. Tenn. Code Annotated 8-31-100 et seq. Related individuals may be employed by the University, but a relative may not supervise the activities of another, including a relative with management responsibility over the function in which his or her family member is employed. Further, the University prohibits enrollment of a faculty member's spouse, children, or siblings in a class for which the faculty member is the instructor of record. Conflicts of Interests/Personal Benefits The university subscribes to the statement issued jointly by the American Association of University Professors and the American Council on Education entitled On Preventing Conflicts of Interest in Government Sponsored Research at Universities. All faculty members who are engaged in research financed wholly or in part by local, state, or federal governments should familiarize themselves with the principles outlined in this document, copies of which are available in the Office of the Vice Provost for Research. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 3 - Faculty Personnel Policies - The University of 4:13:35 PM]No employee of the University of Memphis may use his/her employment or association with the university for personal monetary gain or benefit. UofMPolicy No.UM1692. Employees must report any activity that constitutes a potential conflict of interest to the senior level administrator over the area in which they work. TBR Policy No.1:02:03:10. Sexual, Racial, and Other HarassmentSexual and racial harassment, as well as harassment on the basis of religion, disability, or other protected status, is prohibited not only by University policy but also by various acts of Congress, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Violation of these acts may subject the University and individuals to disciplinary action and may have legal consequences. The University encourages prompt reporting of such harassment and its prompt resolution through either informal or formal procedures. See also UofM Policy No. 1391 ( for complaint and investigation procedures. All complaints lodged with the Affirmative Action Office, whether formal or informal, will be investigated by the University. The University also has a policy against discrimination based upon sexual orientation. Drug-Free Campus and Alcohol Abuse Prevention In accordance with local, state, and federal law, students and employees of the University are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, use, or being under the influence of controlled substances (illicit drugs) and/or alcohol on campus, on property owned or controlled by the University, or as part of any of the University's activities.

Tenure at the University of Memphis provides certain full-time faculty with the assurance of continued employment during the academic year until retirement, or dismissal for adequate cause, financial exigency, or curricular reasons. Tenure does not confer the right to teach during the summer sessions, nor a guarantee of any specific salary. Tenure and/or promotion to a higher academic rank can be awarded only by the Tennessee Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the president of the university. No other individual or entity may confer tenure or promotion to a higher academic rank at the University. The tenure and promotion process begins at the department level and requires an understanding of the objectives and aims, not only of the department or appropriate academic unit, but also of the college and university. Criteria to aid in making these appraisals have been formulated by the individual departments and academic units, the individual colleges, the university, and the Tennessee Board of Regents. Departmental 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]and college criteria are consistent with the policies of the University and the Tennessee Board of Regents, but are tailored to the demands of the specific discipline and are designed to allow each department to maintain the degree of specialization in its faculty that the profession requires. Departmental criteria are approved by the dean, provost, and president. College criteria are approved by the provost and president. Written guidelines should be available on-line and on file in each departmental office and should be distributed to faculty when they join the department, when they come up for pre-tenure review, and when they apply for tenure and promotion. Guidelines should be redistributed to all affected faculty members whenever they are revised or should be available on the Web. In addition to departmental criteria, administrative criteria such as enrollment patterns and trends, curricular changes, program development, financial consideration and rank distribution, are considered in tenure and promotion decisions. Therefore, a decision to deny tenure or deny promotion does not necessarily mean that a faculty member's work or conduct has been unsatisfactory. Definitions of Teaching, Scholarship, and Service Each faculty member is expected to demonstrate a commitment to and competence in teaching, scholarship, and service activities. In a university community, teaching, scholarship, and service are communal responsibilities. However, variation naturally occurs among departments and among faculty members within departments as to the balance among these activities. It is important to emphasize that teaching, scholarship, and service are interrelated, and that some activities may span more than one area. For example, journal editorship might be considered scholarship, or service, or both; dissertation supervision might be considered teaching, or scholarship, or both. Teaching, scholarship, and service should be evaluated individually and collectively during annual review and at the time of tenure and promotion decisions. Teaching Teaching is central to the purposes and objectives of the University of Memphis. It encompasses classroom instruction, course development, mentoring students in academic projects including dissertations, testing, grading, and the professional development of the faculty member as a teacher. Mentoring students at all levels is an important aspect of teaching; creative and effective use of innovative teaching methods and curricular innovations is encouraged. The evaluation of teaching should be adaptable to differences among disciplines. Since such evaluation is a qualitative process, multiple sources of evidence, including student evalua tions for all classes, should be employed. The evaluation should be formative (to improve teaching skills) as well as summative (to judge teaching skills). Scholarship Scholarship is a discipline-based, multidisciplinary activity that advances knowledge and learning by producing new ideas and understanding. Scholarly contributions include peer-evaluated, discipline-appropriate works such as books, articles, chapters, films, paintings, performances, and choreographic or theatrical design. Scholarship can be divided into five sub-categories: application, creative activity, inquiry, integration, and the scholarship of teaching. Each department, considering its relevant discipline or disciplines, may emphasize contributions in some subcategories more than others, as 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]described in its mission statement and other relevant departmental documents. Individual faculty are not expected to contribute in all five subcategories of scholarship. Some overlap in the meaning of the five subcategories is inevitable, and a particular scholarly contribution may fall under more than one subcategory. These subcategories are: Creative activity should be fully accepted as scholarship in departments where such work is appropriate to both professional specialization and teaching. It includes, but is not limited to, choreography and dance performance; creative writing; direction and design of plays; exhibitions of visual arts such as paintings, sculpture, and photography; direction of film and video; and musical composition and performance. Inquiry involves rigorous investigation aimed at the discovery of new knowledge within one's own discipline or area of study; it often serves as the basis for other forms of scholar ship and may result in scholarly publications, funded research, and presentations at profes sional meetings. Integration makes meaningful connections between previously unrelated topics, facts, or observations, such as cross-disciplinary synthesis or an integrative framework within a discipline that results in a publication or presentation in a suitable forum. The scholarship of teaching focuses on transforming and extending knowledge about pedagogy, including appropriate textbooks or educational articles in one's own discipline. Innovative contributions to teaching, if published or presented in a peer-reviewed forum, also constitute scholarship of teaching. The "scholarship of teaching" is not equivalent to teaching. Class room teaching and staying current in one's field are not relevant criteria for evaluating faculty on the "scholarship of teaching." Engaged scholarship now subsumes the scholarship of application. It adds to existing knowledge in the process of applying intellectual expertise to collaborative problem-solving with urban, regional, state, national and/or global communities and results in a written work shared with others in the discipline or field of study. Engaged scholarship conceptualizes "community groups" as all those outside of academe and requires shared authority at all stages of the research process from defining the research problem, choosing theoretical and methodological approaches, conducting the research, developing the final product(s), to participating in peer evaluation. Departments should refine the definition as appropriate for their disciplines and incorporate evaluation guidelines in departmental tenure and promotion criteria. Service Service includes service to the university, service to the profession, and outreach to the community. These functions may overlap in some instances. All faculty members will perform basic citizenship service within the university. This includes, but is not limited to, serving on departmental committees, advising students, and participating in college and university committees. Academic advising of students is an important aspect of the university citizenship of many faculty and will be taken into account in faculty evaluations. Some faculty members may accept more extensive citizenship functions, such as a leadership role in the Faculty Senate, membership on a specially appointed task force, advisor to a university-wide student organization, and membership on a university search committee. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Service to the profession includes association leadership, journal editorships, article and grant proposal review, guest lecturing on other campuses, and other appropriate activities.Outreach, or service to the community, primarily involves sharing professional expertise with the wider community and should directly support the goals and mission of the university. Under very rare circumstances, outreach may include non- professionally related activities outside the University. Some departments and disciplines, given the nature of their profes sional work, will be more involved in outreach than will other departments and disciplines. Community outreach is particularly valuable for an urban university such as the University of Memphis. Evaluation of Effective Teaching, Scholarship, and ServiceUniversity criteria relate to the institution's three traditional missions: teaching, scholarship, and service . These three activities are interrelated and may span more than one mission. Effective teaching is an essential qualification for tenure and promotion, neither of which will be granted in the absence of clear evidence of a candidate's teaching ability and potential for continued development. Excellence in teaching is a strong recommendation for both tenure and promotion, though it cannot be considered in isolation from scholarship and service. Although it is difficult to establish evidence of teaching excellence, each department must develop a procedure to ensure that all factual information relative to the candidate's teaching is available at the time they are considered for tenure and promotion. Evidence of teaching excellence should include, but is not limited to, the following: command of subject matter, ability to organize and present subject matter in a logical and meaningful way, ability to motivate and stimulate creativity in the student population. Documentation of teaching should routinely include: statement of teaching philosophy; course materials; systematic student evaluations for each course each semester, including the summer and the previous spring semester; grade distributions, plus any comments the faculty member chooses to make about the relation between the grade distribution and the nature of the course; and evidence of supervision of student projects and other forms of student mentorships. Departments should choose additional types of documentation such as: open- ended or other student input; student products; teaching recognition; teaching scholarship; peer input; evidence of professional development in teaching; evidence of disciplinary or interdisciplinary program or curricular development; alumni surveys and student exit interviews; and other evidence of excellence in teaching or mentoring, or both. Candidates for tenure and promotion must present evidence of their research and scholarly activities. Such evidence should cite books, journal articles, monographs, creative activity, performances, or exhibitions and must accompany the application for promotion and tenure. The scholarship of teaching goes beyond doing a good job in the classroom; creative teachers should organize, record, and document their efforts in such a way that their colleagues may share their contributions to the art of teaching. Appropriate textbooks or educational articles in one's own discipline and innovative contributions to teaching, if published or presented in a peer reviewed forum, constitute scholarship of teaching. Likewise, the Scholarship of Engagement should cite peer-reviewed publications, collaborative reports, documentation of impact, and continuing external funding as evidence of research activity. Please see the sections entitled "Definition of Teaching, Research, and Service" and "Documenting for 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Tenure and Promotion" for further details. The publication of research in refereed journals or media of similar quality is considered a reliable indication of scholarly ability. In most disciplines, evidence of national recognition is considered the most important criterion in evaluating scholarship for promotion to professor. Evidence of potential for national recognition is considered the most important criterion in evaluating scholarship for promotion to associate professor. Professional scholarly papers presented at international, national, or regional meetings may be appropriate. Written reviews and evaluations by qualified peers, either in person or aided by other forms of reports, or both, are appropriate for performances, compositions, and other artistic creations. Books published by reputable firms and articles in refereed journals, reviewed by recognized scholars, are more significant than those that are not subjected to such rigorous examination. It should be emphasized that quality is more important than quantity. Service is a term encompassing a faculty member's activities in one of three areas: outreach or public service, institutional service, and professional service. Theoutreach or public service function of The University of Memphis is the University's outreach to the community and society at large, with major emphasis on the application of knowledge for the solution of problems with which society is confronted. Outreach primarily involves sharing professional expertise and should directly support the goals and mission of the University. A vital component of the University's mission, public service must be performed at the same high levels of quality that characterize teaching and research. Institutional service refers to work other than teaching and scholarship done at the department, college, or university level. A certain amount of such service is expected of every faculty member; indeed, the University could hardly function without conscientious faculty who perform committee work and other administrative responsibilities. Institutional service includes, but is not limited to, serving on departmental committees, advising students, and participating in college and university committees. Academic advising of students is an important aspect of the University citizenship and will be taken into account in faculty evaluations. Some faculty members may accept more extensive citizenship functions, such as a leadership role in the Faculty Senate, membership on a specially appointed task force, advisor to a university-wide student organization, and membership on a university search committee.Professional service refers to the work done for organizations related to one's discipline or to the teaching profession generally. Service to the profession includes association leadership, journal editorships, article and grant proposal review, guest lecturing on other campuses, and other appropriate activities. While it is impossible to define the exact nature of significant professional service, clearly more is required than organizational membership and attendance; examples of significant service would be that done by an officer of a professional organization or a member of the editorial staff of a journal. The collegiality of the faculty member should be considered in all tenure and promotion decisions. It, however, should be not be considered as a separate evaluative criterion; rather, it should be considered in the context of the candidate's teaching, scholarship/research, and service/outreach. External Peer Review 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Both tenure and promotion to associate professor or professor require external peer review of a candidate's record of scholarly activity by qualified peers who are not affiliated with the University of Memphis. The purpose of external peer reviews is solely to provide an informed, objective evaluation of the quality of the scholarship, research or creative activity of the candidate. It is expected that the external reviewers will be selected from peer or comparable institutions with national reputations in the faculty member's discipline. Though not an absolute requirement, it is also expected that faculty of superior rank will review faculty of lower rank. For example, full professors should review applicants for promotion to professor. Such reviews place a burden on the usually busy schedules of the evaluators. In order to obtain external reviews in a timely manner, the process of developing the lists of external reviewers, as described below, should be initiated during the spring semester preceding the fall tenure and promotion process. The candidate shall develop a list, normally four to eight names, of recommended peer reviewers from outside the University. The candidate may also submit a list (with justifications) of persons who may pose a conflict for consideration by the chairs of the department and the department tenure and promotion committee. In addition, the chairs of the department and the department tenure and promotion committee will develop a list of outside peer reviewers. The chairs must select at least one of the names suggested by the candidate. The department is solely responsible for supplementing the candidate's list with additional reviewers. The dossier should contain at least four external reviews. If it is not possible to obtain four reviews, the reasons must be documented at the departmental level. For each reviewer, there should be an accompanying brief paragraph identifying her/his credentials and a statement regarding the nature of the relationship to the candidate (if any). The external reviewers are expected to provide informed, objective evaluations rather than testimonials. Therefore, no more than one external reviewer can be a past mentor or collaborator of the candidate. To the extent possible, the external reviewers for candidates seeking the rank of professor should be professors themselves. All reviewers should receive the same materials for evaluation; if not, an explanation should be included. Peer reviewers who have agreed to write letters of evaluation should be sent the following: the candidate's curriculum vitae and a letter from the Department Chair to the reviewer, including a request for a written response to the question: "How do you assess the quality of the scholarly and/or creative activity of the candidate;" a deadline for the written response; and a statement that the State of Tennessee has an Open Records Law and that the candidate has access to the outside peer evaluation document. Note: These are minimal requirements and should be interpreted to mean that additional materials related to scholarly activity may be necessary in some departments, colleges or schools. The materials sent to a reviewer should enable her/him to fully assess the scholarship of the candidate in an objective fashion. Evaluation by Chairs The Tennessee Board of Regents requires that department chairs evaluate the faculty in their departments annually and that the results of these evaluations be used as a basis for decisions relating to tenure, promotion, recommendations for salary increases and other personnel actions, including decisions regarding renewal of tenure-track appointments. Each department develops, and revises when appropriate, criteria to be considered in the evaluation of its faculty members' activities and responsibilities. The 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]departmental criteria and any departmental procedures for evaluation are approved by the dean of the college and the provost. This information is distributed to all new faculty and to all current faculty whenever a revision is approved. The University's standard faculty evaluation instrument and planning document are available in the Office of the Provost or may be accessed on-line at The annual review process is conducted in the spring semester and consists of two parts: (1) a review of the faculty member's accomplishments during the prior calendar year, using the previously agreed upon plan of activities for that year as the basis of the review, and (2) establishing a plan of activities for the next year, or for a longer period when appropriate. The review will consider the faculty member's performance in all areas that further the mission of the university, including teaching and advising, research and other scholarly or creative activity, public and university service. Any review of a faculty member's professional performance should be conducted with the full knowledge of the faculty member, should allow the faculty member to be informed of the findings prior to the transmittal of the conclusions of the review, and should allow the faculty member to verify that the review has been based on full and complete information. Faculty Planning During the spring semester, all faculty members submit a current curriculum vitae, a narrative of their accomplishments during the past year (i.e., faculty activity report), and their plans for the upcoming year to their department chair (or other appropriate head of their academic unit if there is no department chair). The chair receives copies of student evaluations for each course that the faculty member has taught during the evaluation period and may also obtain peer input as discussed herein. Both the faculty member and the chair should obtain and include appropriate, similar information from any other relevant department(s) whenever the faculty member is involved in interdisciplinary activities. Generally, the faculty member's accomplishments over only the prior calendar year are considered in the annual review, although a two or three year period of activities may be considered when appropriate. The department chair reviews the material and then prepares a narrative and an evaluation in a Faculty Evaluation and Planning Report. The chair provides an overall evaluation of the faculty member's performance by assigning one of the following five performance categories: (a) exceptional performance, (b) very good performance, (c) good performance, (d) improvement needed, and (e) failure to meet responsibilities. The chair must provide written specifics for ratings of "improvement needed" and "failure to meet responsibilities." The chair's overall rating should take into account a balance of all the faculty member's activities. The department chair uses the annual review process as the primary mechanism for evaluating faculty, for giving specific feedback to faculty on their performance, and for making recommendations on how to improve performance consistent with the department's and/or academic unit's goals in areas of teaching, scholarship, outreach, and service. It is recommended that each department and school refer to the tenure and promotion guidelines as a guide to expectations for continued faculty performance. Faculty planning, both short and long term, begins in the spring during the annual review process. This is a joint endeavor carried out by the faculty member and chair, with results acceptable to both; the plan will take into account academic freedom and the departmental or academic unit's mission. Faculty planning, begun during the annual review process in the spring, is finalized in a formal planning report and 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]submitted at the end of the spring semester. Faculty have the option of revising their plan throughout the year as the balance of their responsibilities dictate. Informal meetings between the chair and each faculty member may be necessary to finalize the planning report. The chair's signature on the planning report indicates the appropriateness of the faculty member's plan. Curriculum Vitae The University of Memphis uses an on-line data form for development of faculty curricula vitae [ Faculty members must submit updated vitae information each spring as part of their annual evaluation, and are encouraged to update these vitae throughout the year. Faculty and administrative staff may access CVs in "view only" mode. Student Evaluations Student evaluations are required for every section of every course, including summer sessions taught by University of Memphis faculty members and includes full-time and part-time instructors and graduate teaching assistants. Faculty members must include student evalua tion results with applications for promotion and tenure. The Student Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness rating system (SETE) is an electronic process. Information about SETE forms, and monitoring capabilities can be found on the provost web site at [ and on each faculty member's portal - SETE channel. Peer Input Department chairs are encouraged to seek peer input regarding faculty members as a part of the evaluation process. The form of such input may vary from discussions between the chair and the faculty to formal committees. Examples of successful peer input in various departments include: formal input from a representative group of faculty either appointed by the chair or selected by the faculty; formal input from a rotating group of tenured faculty; formal input from the departmental tenure and promotion committee; and discussions between the chair and each faculty member in the department. In all of these models, documentation should be reviewed by peers. When a formal committee is used, its makeup should reflect the department's diversity and be as widely inclusive as possible; its membership should rotate among faculty members through the use of staggered terms. Although the majority of the committee members should be tenured, untenured faculty may also serve as members. When part of the annual review process, internal peer review committees within departments may also participate in planning with individual faculty members, evaluate faculty's annual performance, and provide evaluations to department chairs. Faculty Evaluation and Planning Report Subject to the approval of the dean and the provost, each department may develop a set of procedures to be followed and criteria to be considered in the evaluation of a faculty member's activities and responsibilities. A sample instrument, which may be used or modified, is available in the Office of the Provost. Department chairs and others with evaluative and developmental responsibilities will be provided institutional support upon request (through the Office of the Provost) in devising strategies for evaluating, collecting and interpreting data, and acquiring reference materials. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]After the chair has completed and signed the annual Faculty Evaluation and Planning Report, he or she will transmit the form to the faculty member. The faculty member is given an opportunity to read, sign, and/or offer a written response to the document. The chair also may respond in writing to the written comments of the faculty member, and a copy of all such attachments will be included with the evaluation documents when forwarded to the dean of the college for review and when placed in the faculty members' personnel file maintained by the Office of Academic Personnel Services. A faculty member's signature or electronic acknowledgement of the annual Faculty Evaluation and Planning Report does not represent agreement with the evaluation but only that the evaluation was reviewed by the faculty member. Although faculty members may submit comments and/or responses to the evaluation, failure to do so should not be construed as agreement with the results of the evaluation. Each institution's evaluation system must be designed to ensure that both formative and summative information is provided to determine which individuals should participate in appropriate faculty development program(s). If it is determined that faculty development is needed, opportunities to address the need for improvement will be provided. Failure either to participate in a recommended program or to otherwise attain a required level of performance or credential may justify appropriate administrative action (Tennessee Board of Regents memorandum dated January 8, 1992).Role of Evaluation in Renewal of Tenure-Track Appointments and Tenure and Promotion Decisions Evaluations may be considered in determining whether to renew a faculty member's tenure track appointment. The department chair may use the annual evaluation and review process as an opportunity to counsel tenure-track faculty during their probationary period. The mid -tenure review, discussed below, provides an additional opportunity for counseling tenure- of concern and becomes a part of the faculty member's application for tenure. Because a faculty member's annual evaluations and mid-tenure review are a core part of the materials considered for the faculty member's tenure and promotion review, copies of these evaluations and review should be included in the tenure and promotion file of all tenure-track faculty. Evaluation of a faculty member's performance constitutes only one aspect of the final recommendation on tenure or promotion. In addition to evaluation, the administrative assessment of need, enrollment trends, financial resources, rank distribution, and other such matters will also be considered in the recommendation to promote or tenure. Mid-Tenure (Third Year) Review of Probationary Faculty Individual departments and academic units, with the involvement of their dean, will conduct a major evaluation of untenured faculty in tenure-track positions prior to their eligibility to apply for tenure. The purpose of the review is to provide the department tenure and promotion committee, the chair, the college tenure and promotion committee (if utilized), the dean and the faculty member with information about her/his progress toward promotion and tenure. This evaluation is typically near the end of the faculty member's third year and is conducted by the tenure and promotion committee and the chair. Each faculty member is responsible for presenting documentation (dossier) of contributions and accomplishments according to departmental or academic unit, college, and university guidelines. These materials are 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]reviewed by the tenure committee of the department, by the chair and by the dean and are subsequently forwarded to the Office for Faculty Administrative Services for inclusion in the faculty member's permanent file. During this process, the chair and the dean should provide the candidate with information about his or her progress toward application for tenure. ProceduresThe procedure for the mid-tenure review should be the same as that used by the Department for tenure and promotion review. Deliberations and discussions of dossiers will take place in committee meetings. Each candidate's accomplishments should be evaluated with respect to quality as well as quantity within the context of the candidate's roles and responsibilities. The dossier for the mid-tenure review should be the same as the one for tenure and promotion, with the exception of letters from external peer reviewers. The format of the University of Memphis Tenure and Promotion dossier example should be used and contain information documenting evidence of quality in instruction, scholarship, and outreach/service. (The term scholarship will be used to encompass research and creative activity.) The inclusion of non-essential documents is discouraged. Evaluation Criteria The evaluation criteria for the quality of a faculty member's mid-tenure accomplishments should be the same as those used for promotion to associate professor with tenure. The University criteria relate to the institution's traditional missions: instruction, scholarship, and outreach/service. The candidate should have also demonstrated a willingness to work with colleagues in supporting the goals and missions of the department, college, and university. Each department should determine the level of instructional effectiveness, scholarship and outreach/service activities that are appropriate to support its particular goals and missions, consistent with College and University criteria. Feedback The committee chair will prepare a written report based on the recommendation of the tenure and promotion committee members that is submitted to the department chair or equivalent. The report should specify the department's criteria and, in particular, discuss both the strengths and weaknesses of the faculty member's accomplishments in instruction, scholarship, and outreach/service. The report should provide meaningful feedback and direction to the faculty member to assist in planning and organizing subsequent work activities. The department chair will prepare a written report that addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the faculty member's accomplishments in instruction, scholarship, and outreach/service.A copy of the two reports will be presented to the faculty member. The tenure and promotion committee chair, the department chair or equivalent, will meet with the candidate to discuss the reports. The faculty member may write a brief statement in response to the discussions and reports obtained from the department tenure and promotion committee and the department chair. The purpose of this response is to allow the faculty member the opportunity to address any concerns or inaccuracies in the reports. The faculty member may also describe plans for addressing concerns raised during the mid-tenure review. In addition, the response ensures that all participants in the process understand the nature and context of the feedback, thereby 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]minimizing miscommunication. The candidate's dossier, the recommendations made by the department tenure and promotion committee and the department chair, and the candidate's response (if any) constitute the candidate's file. The chair is responsible for forwarding the candidate's file to the dean. Colleges may elect to include the college tenure and promotion committee in the third-year/mid-tenure review process. The dean shall then prepare a written report and, as necessary, may meet with the candidate to discuss the results of the third-year/mid-tenure review. Eligibility for Tenure and PromotionTenureBefore beginning the sixth (or final) probationary year, a faculty member with the rank of assistant professor or higher must make application for tenure. Application and all supporting documentation for tenure should be submitted at the beginning of thefall semester of the sixth or fianl probationary year. Candidates for tenure must meet eligibility requirements for promotion to associate professor or have already attained that rank. Stated another way, anyone recommended for tenure must also be recommended for promotion. Tenure applications receive one of two responses: tenure may be granted; or tenure may be denied. Re-application for tenure is not possible and the seventh year, or other final year following application for tenure, will be terminal if tenure is denied. Faculty holding temporary appointments are not eligible for tenure. Also, faculty may not be tenured in an administrative position. A faculty member will retain tenure in his/her former faculty position when appointed to an administrative position, and those otherwise eligible for tenure and who also hold an administrative position may earn tenure in the faculty position only. Promotion Faculty members may apply for promotion whenever they believe they meet the established criteria. The minimum criteria for promotion is stated herein; however, faculty members applying for promotion must also satisfy any applicable criteria for promotion required by their individual department, academic unit, and/or college. Faculty members are advised, but not required, to confer with their department chair before submitting applications for promotion. Review Process for Tenure and Promotion The tenure and promotion process begins at the departmental or other academic unit level with review of the candidate's application by the department's tenure and promotion committee. This committee forwards its recommendations to the department chair or other appropriate head of an academic unit, who then reviews the application and forwards both the committee's and his/her recommendation to the College. The application is then reviewed at the college level by the college tenure and promotion committee which makes a recommendation; the dean makes his/her recommendation subsequent to action by the college committee. All four recommendations are subsequently forwarded to the Provost. In the event that a chair/head of an academic unit or a dean is not available to make a recommen dation 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]on a tenure or promotion application, the Provost may appoint a substitute from within the appropriate college or accept the application for consideration without such recommendation.Note: Throughout this section, the terms "academic unit" and "head of academic unit" should be substituted for "department" or "department chair," respectively, whenever applicable.Department Committee Candidates for tenure and/or promotion should submit their applications and supporting papers to their department chair, who will transmit the documents directly to the department's tenure and promotion committee. This committee will evaluate the candidate's accomplishments, applying to them all relevant criteria (Tennessee Board of Regents, university, college and department). The judgment and assessment of the candidate's application for tenure by the faculty at the department level is critical because of their familiarity with the candidates and their knowledge of the qualifications necessary for their particular discipline. Therefore, reviewers at every level will utilize dossier materials and professional observations in making their recommendations. Professional observations may be included in the documentation that is prepared at each level of review. The departmental committee will return the applications and supporting papers to the department chair/head of academic unit along with its recommendations and reasons for those recommendations. These recommendations should reflect the full scope of discussions that took place in the committee meetings, and should also contain the rationale for the recommendation that is consistent with the vote of the committee. Ifthe decision of the Department Committee is not unanimous, the committee may also submit to the department chair a minority report with the rationale for dissenting opinions.Department Committee Composition: The tenure and promotion committee of the department consists of all tenured associate professors and professors. For promotion to professor, the subcommittee of tenured professors will make the recommendations. Note: For small departments, some alternate process may be needed. Department Chair The department chair will evaluate the candidate's file, make further recommendations, and then, in cases involving promotion only, meet with the candidate to transmit the recommendations which the committee and the chair have made and reasons for those recommendations. When the chair meets with the candidate being considered for tenure or tenure and promotion, he/she should restrict his/her conversation to the recommendations that have been made, but should not, at this time, address the reasons for the recommendations. In promotional situations, the chair is free to discuss his/her recommendations. Application for promotion may be withdrawn at this point. The major share of the responsibility for appraising a candidate is the responsibility of the department chair and the department committee, who must determine not only present qualifications for tenure and promotion, but also determine the potential for development, an important consideration if the vitality of the University is to be maintained. The appraisal must be more than a mere review of the candidate's activities in teaching, research, and service; it must be a thorough evaluation of these activities and other relevant criteria, supported by substantial evidence. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]If a department chair is being considered for promotion or tenure, the recommendation of the department committee will be transmitted directly to the college dean. College Committee The dean will send the applications and the departmental and chair recommendations directly to the college's tenure and promotion committee. The college committee has responsibility for insuring that the dossiers are consistent with department, college, and university policies as well as for making recommendations concerning the applicant's qualifications for tenure and/or promotion. Its perspective will of necessity be broader than that of the department committee: it will consider such things as the college wide staffing plans, the department's enrollment trends, and the philosophy of the college. Its purpose is to ensure adherence to institutional procedures and criteria, to prevent departmental inbreeding and doctrinal conformity, to review the completeness of the information presented, and to question any omissions in criteria or variations in procedure. The college committee should consider the substance of a faculty member's qualifications to the extent necessary for the performance of its function. The college committee should evaluate the performance of a candidate for tenure and promotion in light of specific written standards from the candidate's department. After completing its evaluation the committee will return the application and supporting papers to the dean with its recommendations and reasons for those recommendations. These recommendations should reflect the full scope of discussions that took place, and should contain the rationale that is consistent with the vote of the committee. If the decision of the College Committee is not unanimous, the committee may also submit to the Dean a minority report with the rationale for dissenting opinions.College Committee Composition The membership requirements and selection procedures are to be determined by each college; however, only tenured associate professors and professors may serve on tenure and promotion committees. At least two thirds of the members of the college tenure and promotion committee should be elected by department faculties, with the remaining third appointed by the dean. Such a combination will ensure the full representation of faculty competence in teaching, scholarship, and service. Single Participation: A member of the College Tenure and Promotion Committee may vote at the departmental level, but cannot vote at the College level on candidates from their department. Participation of Spouses: Spouses may not participate in committee deliberations at any level. DeanThe dean will evaluate the candidate's file, make further recommendations and, in cases involving promotion only, meet with the candidate to transmit recommendations which the college committee and the dean have made, along with reasons for those recommendations. At this point the candidate has one last opportunity to withdraw the application for promotion. If a dean is being considered for promotion or tenure, the recommendation of the college committee will go directly to the provost. Provost 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]The provost will review the file from an even broader perspective than that used in the college. In addition to and exclusive of individual qualifications and performance, consideration must be given to such matters as department imbalance in rank distribution, potential for continued staff additions, prospective retirements and resignations, enrollment patterns, program changes, and other significant institutional considerations. The provost will notify the candidate of the recommendation that he or she will make to the president regarding the candidate's application no later than seven (7) days after the beginning of the spring academic term. If a candidate decides to appeal a negative decision for tenure and promotion, he/she must make application to the university tenure and promotion appeals committee within thirty (30) days of the beginning of the spring academic term. In the case of a negative recommendation, the provost will give written reason(s) for the decision.Appeals of Negative Tenure or Promotion Decision The responsibility of the appeals committee is to entertain appeals of negative recommendations concerning tenure and promotion by the provost and to be advisory to the president in such matters. If, after the provost's tenure and promotion recommendations are announced, a faculty member wishes to appeal a negative recommendation, the request must be submitted to the chair of the university committee within thirty (30) days of the beginning of the spring academic term. The committee may review information related to the appeal to whatever extent it wishes and then make its recommendations to the president. University Tenure and Promotion Appeals Committee Composition Each year, a pool of eighteen faculty members is formed to hear tenure and promotion appeals. Ten of the members will be appointed by the Faculty Senate and eight will be appointed by the president. The pool should reflect diversity in terms of race, gender, and college/school. Membership is for three years with staggered terms to ensure conformity and continuity in the committee function. Nine members of the pool will be assigned to hear each case, with the work being divided as evenly as possible. To the extent practicable, the committees should maintain diversity in actual participation, especially if issues of diversity play a role in a particular case. Role of Committee in Advising Candidates of Process At any stage of the appeals process, an appellant has the opportunity to enlist the aid and advice of a Faculty Appeals Advocate. There are three such Appeals Advocates who are appointed by the Faculty Senate for three-year terms. The Appeals Advocates are tenured faculty at the Professor rank who are well versed in the appeals process, not currently serving on either of the Appeals Committees, and able to serve as conflict-free advisors to an appellant during the appeals process. An Appeals Advocate can provide information about appeals procedures and the grounds for appeals, assist appellants in developing their appeals, and advise appellants during an appeals hearing. Grounds for Appeal If there is an appeal of the recommendation for tenure or promotion, additions relevant 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]to the appeal may be made to the appellant's file. The Appeals Committee will consider only the issues relating to the following grounds for appeal: 1. Unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex, age, race, religion, national origin, veteran's status, disability, or other grounds protected by state or federal law; 2. Violations of principles on academic freedom as outlined in the Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the American Association of University Professors. 3. Substantive procedural errors (based upon the procedures outlined in the FacultyHandbook, college tenure and promotion guidelines, or departmental guidelines) in the manner in which the application was reviewed; or 4. Mistake in the review of a dossier such that a reviewing body is unaware of a credential that satisfies a requirement for tenure or promotion. 5. An arbitrary, capricious, or unsubstantiated recommendation. If any of these grounds is found to have existed, the Appeals Committee will then consider whether the ground adversely affected the ultimate recommendation. Inaddition, the Appeals Committee may hear an appeal in any instance where there is a negative decision by the provost despite positive recommendations at all four levels of review (department committee, department chair, college committee, college dean). The Appeals Committees will not substitute their judgment for that exercised at the levels of review and will restrict their assessment to the areas stipulated in the section entitled "Grounds for Appeal." Appeals Committee Procedures In the notice of appeal to the committee chair, the person seeking the appeal (complainant) must identify the grounds for the appeal sought. The complainant should pursue only those grounds for which there is credible evidence supporting the appeal. It is the complainant's responsibility to present the evidence to support each ground that serves as the basis for the appeal. Such evidence could be documentary or could include testimony, but there must be proof, rather than just accusations, that the ground is satisfied. If the Appeals Committee determines that a hearing on the appeal should be conducted, the following procedures shall apply: The complainant (accompanied by an Appeals Advocate and/or other counsel if desired) and participants may be present throughout the duration of the hearing. Witnesses must wait outside the hearing room until called and must leave upon completion of their testimony. Although the hearings are informal, it has been found necessary to adopt a quasi-legal process to ensure that all participants have an opportunity to be heard. Hearing Process: 1. The provost will first address the committee to explain the process for reaching his decision and to present whatever documentation is deemed appropriate. It is recommended that the provost limit her/his remarks to ten minutes; however, the time limit will not be absolute since he/she does not participate in all of the proceedings of the hearing. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]2. The complainant will make her/his opening statement, usually a declaration of how he/she feels he/she was wronged, citing the particular ground(s) upon which the appeal is based and how he/she intends to prove the case. Theopening statement should only be an overview of the appeal and shall be limited to ten (10) minutes. 3. Each participant who desires to do so can make an opening statement, which again shall be only an overview of the participant's position. These opening statements shall also be limited to ten (10) minutes per participant. 4. The complainant calls her-/himself as a witness and states details of her/his case, specifying each ground upon which he/she has acomplaint and substantiating each one in turn with proof. If improper procedure related to the department criteria is to be used as a basis for appeal, the appellant is requested to provide a copy of her/his department's criteria to the committee. Note: Thecommittee often finds it difficult to properly assess the quality of research work of the complainant. Therefore, if the complainant intends to use the improper evaluation of her/his research efforts as a basis for appeal, the committee requests that he/she bring members of her/his field of expertise as witnesses to vouch for the quality of the complainant's research efforts. 5. Participants may question the complainant; then committee members may question the complainant. 6. The complainant calls her/his witnesses in the order he/she deems best. Thewitnesses will be informed that the procedures are informal and that the witnesses may respond to questions as they see fit; e.g., they may refuse to answer, ask for clarification, answer portions of compound questions and omit portions, etc. Witness testimony should not be repetitive and should focus on providing information regarding the particular ground for appeal sought by the complainant. 7. Complainant may question each witness, then participants may question each witness, then committee members may question each witness. 8. Participants may call themselves as witnesses and present such data and opinion as they see fit. 9. Complainant may question the participants, then committee members may question the participant. 10. Participants may call and question such witnesses as they deem necessary in the order they wish. 11. The complainant may question each witness after the participant is completed, then the committee members may question the witness. 12. The Provost will return to answer any questions that the complainant, the participants, or the committee members may have. 13. Summary statement by the complainant shall be limited to a summary of the proof presented, or highlighting of the specific support for each ground upon which a hearing was granted. Summary statements shall last no longer than ten (10) minutes. 14. Summary statements by the participants shall last no longer than ten (10) minutes. 15. Participants and complainant are dismissed. If the case is completed, the committee may move to immediate discussion or postpone discussion to another time.16. The committee will discuss and vote on the ground(s) for appeal that is presented by the complainant If, and only if, there is a positive vote on that identified ground, the committee will discuss and vote on whether the identified ground may have interfered with an appropriate vote on the candidate's record. 17. After discussion and a vote, the committee chairperson will phone the complainant as soon as practical and inform her/him of the decision. A 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]memorandum will be sent to the president, provost, complainant, and participants informing them of the decision and findings of the committee. Appeals Committee Recommendations By simple majority vote, the Appeals Committee will advise (with supporting rationale) the President in one of three ways: (1) that one or more of the grounds were found to be valid by the weight of the evidence, and the committee believes that this adversely affected the ultimate recommendation; 2) that one or more of the grounds were found to have occurred by the weight of the evidence, but the committee believes that this did not adversely affect the ultimate recommendation; or 3) that no grounds were found to exist. If the decision of the Appeals Committee is not unanimous, the committee may also submit to the president a minority report with the rationale for dissenting opinions. Peer committees have qualified privilege of academic confidentiality against disclosure of individual tenure votes unless there is evidence that casts doubt upon the integrity of the committees. Note: Tennessee Board of Regents Policy on Appeals (TBR Policy No.1:02:11:00) provides that absent an alleged violation of state or federal law or inconsistent application of University policy, decisions that are not appealable to the chancellor include (a) non-renewal of a tenure track faculty appointment during the first four years of the probationary period, and (b) denial of tenure unaccompanied by notice of termination in the sixth year of the probationary period. President After receiving recommendations from the provost and the university appeals committee, the president makes final recommendations to the Tennessee Board of Regents and notifies the candidate of this recommendation. In the case of a negative recommendation, the president will give the candidate written reason(s) for the decision..Tennessee Board of Regents After considering the president's recommendations, the Tennessee Board of Regents will take final action on the applications and report their decision to the president, who will transmit official notification of the tenure decision to each candidate. Preparing for Tenure and PromotionDocumenting Performance: Teaching, Scholarship/Research, Service/Outreach Applications for tenure and promotion are requested via a letter to the department chair. No form is specified for this letter, yet it should be as concise and complete as possible. The letter should be accompanied by one copy of each document described in the section below entitled "Dossier." Great care should be taken in the preparation of the dossier. Nothing may be added to or removed from a candidate's dossier after it has been evaluated by the department's tenure and promotion committee. This requirement insures that each reviewing authority will examine exactly the same evidence in making decisions on tenure and/ or promotion application. This rule notwithstanding, The Appeals Committee may request such information that it deems necessary to form its recommendations to the president. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Candidates for tenure and/or promotion should work closely with their department chairs to define goals and to establish documented evidence of effectiveness to be sure that they are meeting the obligations and performing at the level of expectation of the department, college, and university. Physical evidence of effective performance shouldinclude items such as syllabi, student evaluations, and selected course materials to support teaching; copies of published articles or books, or written reviews and evaluations by qualified peers of the candidate's performances, compositions, and artistic creations to document scholarship; and documentation of service and outreach activities. All such evidence becomes part of the faculty member's ongoing and continuously updated file (dossier), the specific content of which will vary according to discipline. Types of evidence for effectiveness in teaching and mentoring include the following. Command of the subject Ability to organize and present subject matter in a logical and meaningful way Ability to motivate undergraduates Ability to stimulate creativity in graduate students Creative and effective use of innovative teaching methods and curricular innovations.Examples of documentation for teaching and mentoring include the following: Statement of teaching philosophy Course materials Systematic student evaluations for each course each semester (including summer and previous spring) Grade distribution (and comments, if desired, about relationship of grades and nature of course) Evidence of supervision of student projects and other forms of mentorships Evaluation by department chairs Comments of peers Teaching awards Types of evidence and documentation for effectiveness in research and scholarly/creative activities include the following: Publications, e.g., appropriate textbooks, books or chapters in books, articles in refereed journals, monographs, refereed and non-refereed conference proceedings, book reviews and other related items, written reviews and evaluations by qualified peers. Papers presented, e.g., papers presented at local, state, regional, national and international professional meetings (significance of the content and selection process should be considered in the process of reviewing such presentations). Performances or exhibitions, e.g., performances or exhibitions that are invited or juried by nationally or regionally recognized members or groups within the discipline. Research in progress, e.g., verification of stages or development for research in progress is mandatory. Contributions to the art of teaching, e.g., appropriate textbooks or education articles in peer review forum, development of computer software or audiovisual media, and so forth. Contributions to engaged scholarship including collaborative reports, documentation of impact, external funding, and peer-reviewed journals. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Types of evidence and documentation for professionally related services include the following:Service to the University, e.g., participation and leadership roles in departmental, college or school and university committees; participation in university governance; administrative service; advising students; recruitment activities; service to student organizations; other related activities Service to one's discipline, e.g., memberships and leadership roles in professional organizations at state, regional, or national levels. Service to the larger society, e.g., presentations related to the discipline; professional advice and counsel to groups or individuals; other types of service, particularly in the university's service area. Other factors to be considered include: Evidence of Collegiality. Collegiality is an intrinsic part of the review of any candidate. It should not, however, be considered apart from teaching, scholarship/research and service. Rather, it should be considered to be essential to the role that the faculty member plays in each of these areas. Professional growth, e.g., courses taken for credit, courses audited, seminars attended and independent study activities (much of this evidence will be submitted on the section on teaching, service, research, and scholarly/creative activity).The Dossier Candidates who are not sure what to include in their dossiers or how to organize the material should seek help from their chairs and colleagues, particularly those who have served on tenure and promotion committees. However, the following recommendations represent a general set of procedures designed to establish a minimal degree of uniformity across colleges and schools. Variability may occur among colleges in the implementation of these recommendations due to differences in the structure and/or size of colleges and schools. Candidates prepare dossiers for review in consultation with the Department Chair. The materials specified in the University of Memphis dossier must be included. The candidate should assemble his/her materials in a three-ring notebook that is organized in the following manner: (APPLICANT'S FULL NAME) 200_ - 200_ Tab I.

OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION Sample forms as follows are contained on the Provost's Website at and promotion history external evaluators letter external evaluators' list course evaluation summary Supporting materials for tenure and promotion applications forwarded by the deans are to be assembled in notebooks with covers that are labeled with the name of the applicant, department and college. It is suggested that the dossiers be bound to prevent additions or deletions to the dossier. Examples of scholarly and/or creative activities are not to be forwarded for review, but should be retained in the department office to allow college and campus level reviews if requested. The materials that are forwarded to the provost do not have to be numbered by page; however, they should be assembled in the order as specified above. College/School Guidelines for Tenure and Promotion Each college and school within the University should develop written guidelines that articulate its standards for tenure and promotion. These guidelines should reflect the breadth and diversity of its faculty while remaining consistent with the guidelines established in this Handbook. While the departmental guidelines should be the candidate's primary source for tenure and/or promotion documentation, the college/school guidelines should establish standards for faculty performance and evaluation. They should also provide information concerning the role of the college/school committee, the manner in which the committee is selected, and the manner in which the dean makes his/her recommendations. It would likewise be desirable to set a minimal standard for mentoring of untenured faculty. These guidelines should be made available to faculty members at the time they join the faculty, at the time of mid-tenure review, and at the time of application for tenure or promotion. For more information about the College/School Guidelines, please see Review Processfor Tenure and Promotion . Departmental Guidelines for Tenure and Promotion At the heart of the tenure and promotion process is the need for all departments (a) to spell out specific requirements for tenure and promotion, (b) to inform faculty yearly as to their progress, and (c) to communicate these criteria to the college committee, 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]deans, and the provost. Accountability for implementing this process begins at the departmental level with clearly defined standards for the evaluation of faculty for tenure and promotion. Specific written guidelines are developed at the departmental level and reviewed by a college-level faculty committee advisory to the dean, and are approved by the dean and the provost. These guidelines should be distributed to faculty members at the time they join the faculty, at the time of pre-tenure review, and at the time of application for tenure or promotion. These written guidelines are to be discipline-specific, although in harmony with general University guidelines. They should contain the specific criteria and procedures for faculty evaluations and should be updated as needed. Departmental standards are to be included in the tenure and promotion materials sent forward from the department to the college and University levels on behalf of the candidate. In addition to developing and distributing specific standards, it is of crucial importance to assist new untenured faculty through the use of a mentor system. Recommendations for or against faculty eligible for tenure originate from the department or division in which the faculty member is assigned and include appropriate participation in the recommendation by the tenured faculty in that department or division. Fast-Track for Tenure From time to time, the University will find it necessary to expedite tenure review in order to recruit high-quality faculty. In those cases, the candidate's application file will take the place of the traditional dossier and will be submitted to the departmental committee, the department chair, the college committee, the Dean, the Provost and the President for review before being forwarded to the Tennessee Board of Regents. Because recruitment is often time sensitive, the department and college committees are requested to devise methods for expedited review of the candidate's application regardless of the time of year in which the application is submitted. Letters of offer to these candidates should include language that suggests expedited tenure review, but should not promise positive outcomes. The letters should, moreover, indicate that the file will be forwarded to the Tennessee Board of Regents for review at its first meeting in the new academic year. Probationary Period Prior to Application for Tenure A faculty member on a tenure-track appointment must serve in a faculty position at the University during a probationary period prior to eligibility for application for tenure. The standard probationary period is six years, unless otherwise prescribed in writing and approved by the dean, provost and president. Absent an approved exception, application for tenure and all supporting documentation must be submitted at the beginning of the fall semester of the sixth or final probationary year. Exceptions that may affect the length of the probationary period are addressed in the sections entitled "Credit for Prior Service," "Credit for Administrative Position or Transfer," "Extension of the Probationary Period," "Stopping the Clock," and "Leaves of Absence."From time to time, an untenured faculty member may receive permission to return to school to obtain a terminal degree in his/her discipline. If the faculty member is in a tenure-track position while in school, commencement of the tenure clock will be delayed until he/she completes all degree requirements. The tenure clock will commence at the beginning of the fall semester of the academic year that follows 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]successful completion of the degree program. Credit for Prior Service At the discretion of the president, credit toward completion of the probationary period may be permitted for previous full time service at other colleges, universities, or institutes, provided that the prior service is relevant to the needs and criteria of the University of Memphis. Any credit for prior service that is recognized and agreed to must be confirmed in writing at the time of the initial appointment. Also, at the discretion of the president, credit toward completion of the probationary period may be given for a maximum of three years of previous full-time service in a temporary faculty appointment at the University of Memphis or in an earlier tenure track appointment at the University of Memphis which has been followed by a break in service. Any credit for prior service must be included in the appointment letter tothe candidate and must be approved by the chair, dean and provost before the offer is made. In these cases, the faculty member is expected to submit a dossier that is consistent with the guidelines outlined in the Handbook "Preparing for Tenure and Promotion." His/her application will be considered during the regular fall/spring tenure and promotion cycle. From time to time, clinical and research faculty may become eligible for tenure-track positions. In these cases, the faculty member may be given credit for time in rank as a clinical or research professor, or may be given credit for previous experience at other institutions. Credit for Administrative Position or Transfer Time or a prorated portion of the time served in an administrative position may be credited toward the probationary period, provided that the faculty member maintains significant involvement in academic pursuits (i.e., teaching and scholarship). The faculty member must initiate the tenure action in his or her home department or academic unit, even if the faculty member is currently serving in a administrative position outside of the department or academic unit. When a faculty member is serving a probationary period in an academic unit (e.g., a department or division) or program and is then transferred to another academic unit or program, they may, with the written approval of the president, elect to begin a new probationary period. Time spent in the first appointment will count toward establishing the probationary period unless a change is approved in writing by the President. Extension of Probationary PeriodA faculty member in a tenure-track appointment may request a one-year extension to the probationary period only when such probationary period was originally negotiated for less than six years. Such extensions are allowed when a faculty member requires additional time to develop a dossier that adequately reflects the candidate's potential long-term contributions to the department. Extensions will not be granted if the total probationary period exceeds six years. A faculty member seeking an extension of the probationary period must submit his/her request, in writing, addressing the considerations described above. The request is to be submitted to the department chair for consideration and recommendation. The chair's recommendation is forwarded to the dean of the faculty member's college for 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]consideration and recommendation; thence to the provost for consideration and recommendation; and finally to the president for approval or denial. The president will notify the faculty member, in writing, of the decision to approve or deny the request for extension within one month of submission. A faculty member may apply for a maximum of two (2) extensions in one-year increments so long as the total probationary period does not exceed six years. Requests for a second extension follow the same procedure and are subject to the same considerations as the original extension. Requests for extension will not be granted retroactively. Stopping the Clock A faculty member in a tenure-track position may request to "stop the clock" during his/her probationary period when circumstances exist that interrupt his/her normal progress toward building a case for tenure. In such cases, the faculty member may request to stop the clock for one year if he/she demonstrates that circumstances reasonably warrant extension. Reasons for stopping the clock will typically be related to a personal or family situation requiring attention and commitment that consumes the time and energy normally used to address faculty duties and professional development. Examples may include, but are not limited to, childbirth or adoption, care of dependents, medical conditions or obligations, physical disasters or disruptions, or similar circumstances that require a fundamental alteration of one's professional life. The intent of this policy is to serve the best interests of the University while providing neither preference to nor adverse effect on a faculty member's process of developing a case for tenure. A faculty member seeking to "stop the clock" must submit his/her request, in writing, addressing the considerations described above. The request is to be submitted to the department chair for consideration and recommendation. The chair's recommendation is forwarded to the dean of the faculty member's college for consideration and recommendation; thence to the provost for consideration and recommendation; and finally to the president for approval or denial. The president will notify the faculty member, in writing, of the decision to approve or deny the request for extension within one month of submission. Stop the clock requests based upon a faculty member's health or care for an immediate family member should be submitted to the Office of Legal Counsel for review. A faculty member may apply for a maximum of two (2) "stop the clock" periods. Requests for a second extension follow the same procedure and are subject to the same considerations as the original extension. "Stop the clock" requests will not be granted retroactively. Leaves of Absence Only full time continuous service at the University is to be included in the probationary period, except for a period covered by an approved leave of absence. The period for an approved leave of absence will be excluded from the requisite probationary period unless the provost has specified in writing prior to approving the leave that it will be included. No more than one year of an approved leave may be included in the total probationary period. Leaves of absence will not be granted retroactively. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Non-Renewal of Appointment Following Unsuccessful Application for TenureFaculty members on tenure track appointments who complete their sixth year of the probationary period will either be recommended for tenure and promotion to associate or full professor by the president, or they will be given notice of non-renewal of the appointment. The University's notice of non-renewal should be given no later than May 15 of the sixth academic year or within thirty (30) days of exhaustion of any appeals. Upon receipt of notice of such non-renewal, the faculty member will be eligible for a one-year non-renewable appointment at the University. Non-Renewal of Tenure- Track Contracts Tenure-track faculty are subject to non-renewal of their appointments during their probationary periods with appropriate notice. The non-renewal or non-reappointment of any faculty member on a tenure track appointment does not necessarily carry an implication of unsatisfactory work or conduct. A faculty member whose tenure track appointment is not renewed will be given an oral statement of the reason(s) and an opportunity for discussion with the president or the president's representative. Faculty members on tenure track appointments will not be terminated during the termof their appointment except for reasons that would be sufficient for the termination of tenured faculty. The same procedures for the termination of a tenured faculty member are followed to dismiss for cause a non-tenured faculty member prior to the expiration of the one-year term of the appointment. Tenure track faculty whose annual appointments will not be renewed will be given written notice of non-renewal of their appointment contracts in conformance with the following schedule: Not later than April 1 of the first academic year of service if the appointment expires at the end of that year; or, if the appointment expires during an academic year, at least two months in advance of the expiration date. Not later than January 1 of the second academic year of service, if the appointment expires at the end of that year; or, if the appointment expires during the academic year, at least five months in advance of the expiration date. Not later than May 15 preceding the third or subsequent year of service, if the appointment expires at the end of that year; or, if the appointment expires during the academic year, at least twelve months in advance of the expiration date. Notice of non-renewal becomes effective on personal delivery of the written notice to the faculty member, or on the date the notice is mailed to the faculty member's home address of record, whichever first occurs. Dates for notice of non-renewal are not affected by any credit for prior service. Failure to give timely notice of non-renewal of a contract will not result in a tenured appointment, but the faculty member will be eligible for an additional one year, non renewable appointment. Failure to submit an application for tenure in the academic year that precedes the end of the probationary period will result in non-renewal of the candidate's contract for the following year. Unlike unsuccessful applications for tenure, the candidate will not be accorded an automatic one-year contract if he/she fails to apply for tenure at the specified time. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Non-Renewal of Clinical and Research Faculty AppointmentsClinical and research faculty are subject to non-renewal of their appointments withappropriate notice. The non-renewal or non-reappointment of any faculty member on a clinical or research appointment does not necessarily carry an implication of unsatisfactory work or conduct. A faculty member whose clinical or research appointment is not renewed will be given an oral statement of the reason(s) and an opportunity for discussion with the president or the president's representative. Clinical or research faculty whose annual appointments will not be renewed will be given written notice of non-renewal of their appointment contracts in conformance with the following schedule: Not later than April 1 of the first academic year of service if the appointment expires at the end of that year; or, if the appointment expires during an academic year, at least two months in advance of the expiration date. Not later than January 1 of the second academic year of service, if the appointment expires at the end of that year; or, if the appointment expires during the academic year, at least five months in advance of the expiration date. Not later than May 15 preceding the third or subsequent year of service, if the appointment expires at the end of that year; or, if the appointment expires during the academic year, at least twelve months in advance of the expiration date. Notice of non-renewal becomes effective on personal delivery of the written notice to the faculty member, or on the date the notice is mailed to the faculty member's home address of record, whichever first occurs. Dates for notice of non-renewal are not affected by any credit for prior service. Failure to give timely notice of non-renewal of a contract will not result in a tenured appointment, but the faculty member will be eligible for an additional one year, non renewable appointment. Faculty members on clinical or research appointments will not be terminated during the term of their appointments except for reasons that would be sufficient for the termination of tenured faculty. The same procedures for the termination of a tenured faculty member are followed to dismiss a clinical or research faculty member for cause prior to the expiration of the one-year term of the appointment. Post-Tenure Evaluation and Faculty Development Academic Tenure Tenure's importance derives from the significant benefits it confers not just on faculty but on colleges and universities themselves. Most critically, tenure safeguards the academic freedom so vital to open academic inquiry and discourse. It also enables faculty members to engage in long range and experimental projects that might not yield immediate results. It permits more open and candid faculty participation on committees dealing with controversial issues. Tenure is earned after a probationary period of six years. At the end of that time the applicant's entire record, including evaluations from peers at other institutions, is carefully scrutinized by Departmental and College committees, by the appropriate Department Chair and College Dean, and by the University Provost. This process is intended to insure that a tenured faculty member is a highly competent and conscientious professional who not only deserves to be employed by the University, but who also contributes significantly to the education of its students. Tenure is not a sinecure guaranteeing lifelong employment. The University of 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]Memphis, like most other institutions of higher learning, has a well- developed policy allowing it to terminate tenured faculty for "adequate cause." The standards for "termination for adequate cause" are defined by statute at TennesseeCode Annotated 49-8-302, in the Tennessee Board of Regents policy on Academic Freedom, Responsibility, and Tenure, No. 5:02:03:00 and in this Handbook in the subsection entitled Termination for Adequate Cause. The University has the burden of proving, through a formal hearing, that the tenured faculty member in question should be terminated on this basis. Faculty Development Faculty development resources should be available to all faculty to help them meet their maximum potential and to acquire new skills, technologies, and bodies of knowledge in a society that is rapidly changing. In the area of teaching, sources of faculty development should provide information on course development, instructional techniques and technologies, pedagogical strategies that promote learning and effective methods of collaboration with student teaching assistants. In the area of scholarship, sources of faculty development should assist the faculty in enhancing the quantity and quality of written publications, conference presentations, proposals for external funding, performances, and creative products. In the area of outreach and service, sources of faculty development should be available to assist the faculty in contributing to departments, colleges, universities, communities, and professions. The Department chair has the primary responsibility for counseling faculty members on how to improve their performances in areas of teaching, scholarship, and service. When a faculty member is in need of improvement, as defined in the annual evaluation, that individual may be assigned a mentor, either from the department or outside of the department, who provides suggestions on improving teaching, scholarly activities, outreach and service. Each department will devise mechanisms to fulfill these objectives, such as a peer faculty evaluation and development committee at the departmental level. The Advanced Learning Center may also be used at the university level. The chair, in consultation with mentors and faculty within the department, has the primary responsibility for making suggestions on how to improve teaching, scholarly productivity, outreach and service. Faculty development is particularly critical for faculty who have persistent unsatisfactory performance. A more elaborate process of faculty evaluation and development is recommended for a faculty member who has a history of unsatisfactory performance. The chair has the primary responsibility of dispensing resources to faculty based on the annual faculty evaluation. These incentives include research support, travel funds, assignment of duties, summer teaching, and merit increases in salary. The dean, provost, and president may provide additional incentives to faculty members whose performance has been judged exceptional over a long period. These incentives include salary increases, funds for scholarly activities, and endowed faculty titles. Unsatisfactory Performance of Tenured Faculty Unsatisfactory performance by a tenured faculty member requires additional scrutiny by the Chair, Department, and University. Unsatisfactory performance in post tenure review will lead directly to constructive efforts for faculty development. Unsatisfactory performance is distinct from "termination for cause," which has more 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]stringent standards and a more stringent process, enabling assurance of academic responsibility and academic freedom. Since professional practices vary according to discipline, each Department or Division will be required to develop guidelines, in consultation with the Dean, that define standards of performance in teaching, scholarship, outreach, and service. The chair's overall evaluation of a faculty member determines whether the faculty member receives a rating of unsatisfactory performance. An evaluation of (d) improvement needed or (e) failure to meet responsibilities initiates a process of further evaluation and faculty development. It is the responsibility of the university to provide resources for faculty development and it is the responsibility of the faculty member to use the resources to make needed improvements. If the faculty member is rated in the "improvement needed" category for two successive years, an ad hoc committee within the Department will review the Chair's evaluation and, if in agreement, will prepare a "faculty development program" which will outline the identified problems, suggest methods for improvement, and create a system for evaluating progress toward correcting the identified problems. An evaluation of "improvement needed" should never be considered sufficient cause for triggering procedures for termination. A much more serious level of unsatisfactory performance exists when a faculty member fails to meet his or her responsibilities. Whenever a faculty member receives an evaluation of "failure to meet responsibilities" by the chair of his or her department or division in any given year, an ad hoc committee within the department will review the chair's evaluation and, if in agreement, will prepare a "faculty development report" in collaboration with the faculty member and the chair, which identifies specific problems, methods of improving performance, and systems of evaluating progress toward correcting the problems. In cases where the chair and the department review committee arrive at different conclusions, the dean will arbitrate and issue an evaluation of the faculty member for that year. If the faculty member or the chair contests the dean's decision, an ad hoc grievance committee will be constituted at the level of the University to review the decision. The composition of the ad hoc committee will be decided by the Provost in consultation with the dean, the chair, and the faculty member, in an effort to select an unbiased committee with adequate expertise to evaluate the faculty member. If the faculty member receives an evaluation indicating "failure to meet responsibilities" for a second successive year and the faculty member requests an independent evaluation of his or her performance, the faculty member's personnel file will be reviewed by the dean and the college tenure and promotion committee, who will judge whether the chair's evaluation of "failure to meet responsibilities" is warranted under the specific department's guidelines. It is the right of the faculty member who receives an evaluation of unsatisfactory performance to examine any and all evaluation records and to offer rebuttals to any perceived inaccuracies in them. A final decision concerning whether the chair's evaluation of "failure to meet responsibilities" is warranted lies with the dean of the college after full consideration of the recommendation of the college tenure and promotion committee. If a faculty member receives an evaluation of "failure to meet responsibilities" for a third successive year, the president's appeals committee, the provost, and the president review the faculty members personnel file in order to judge whether the chair's evaluation is warranted. If the president decides that the evaluation of "failure to meet responsibilities" is warranted, then the process of termination for adequate cause may 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]be initiated. The mere fact of successive negative reviews shall not in itself constitute evidence of "adequate cause" for dismissal, however. Nor shall it in any way diminish the administration's obligation to bear the burden of proof and to demonstrate through an adversarial proceeding, not only that negative evaluations rest on fact, but that the facts rise to the level of adequate cause for dismissal. Expiration, Relinquishment, and Termination of Tenure Expiration of Tenure Tenure status expires when a faculty member retires. In addition, tenure will expire if a faculty member can no longer perform assigned duties or carry out the responsibilities of a faculty member due a physical or mental condition, as established by an appropriate medical authority. Relinquishment of Tenure Faculty relinquish or waive the right to tenure when they resign from the University of Memphis. The willful failure to report for service on the designated date that begins any academic term is considered to be a resignation unless, in the opinion of the president, the faculty member shows good cause for the failure. Tenured faculty maintain their tenure if transferred or reclassified by the university to another department or division. Tenure is not relinquished during periods of approved leaves of absences or during periods of service in administrative positions at the university. Transfer of Tenure Faculty who hold a tenured appointment in a department or other academic unit, and then are transferred to another department or academic unit retain their tenure status. A faculty member cannot be compelled to relinquish tenure as a condition of the transfer. Termination of Tenure for Reasons of Financial Exigency Tenured faculty may be terminated because of financial exigency at the University of Memphis if the Tennessee Board of Regents declares such a condition. Personnel decisions (including those related to tenured faculty) resulting from a declaration of financial exigency at the University must comply with TBR Policy No. 5:02:06:00. Termination of Tenure for Curricular ReasonsTenured faculty members may be terminated for curricular reasons if (a) a program is deleted from the curriculum, or (b) there is substantial and continued reduction of student enrollment in a field. Before declaring that curricular reasons exist for terminating tenure, the president will ensure substantive participation by the Faculty Senate, the affected unit(s), and appropriate administrative officers in identifying the specific curricular reasons, evaluating the long term effects on the university's curriculum and strategic planning goals, and the advisability of initiating further action. If significant reorganization within a college is warranted, all affected faculty will be systematically and formally consulted. At the very least, systematic and formal consultation will include a formal proposal circulated several days (preferably at least a month) prior to a meeting of all interested faculty. Those who feel this process has not allowed full expression of all points of view will have the right to be heard formally by the provost and later by the president. If significant changes are to be made despite strong opposition, they should, if possible and desirable, be phased in 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]gradually. Prior to initiating the process described below, the president will present a description of curricular reasons that warrant the termination of tenured faculty member(s). Each of these reasons will denote shifts in staffing needs that warrant greater reductions than those which are accommodated annually in light of shifting positions from one department to another or among colleges to handle changing enrollment patterns. The president, after determining that curricular reasons may warrant the termination of tenured faculty, will inform the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate. At the earliest possible date after this notification, as agreed to by the president and the Executive Committee, the president or his or her designee will appear before the Senate for the purpose of presenting all relevant information. Senators and affected unit members will have an opportunity to pose questions and seek further information. The Faculty Senate will respond, in writing, within thirty days of this meeting. After determining that termination of one or more tenured faculty members is required for curricular reasons cited above, the president will furnish each faculty member to be terminated a written statement of the reasons for the termination. Those reasons will address fully the curricular circumstances that warranted the termination and will indicate the manner and the information in and upon which the decision to terminate was reached. The president's written statement will also indicate that the faculty member has the opportunity to object in writing to the decision. If a faculty member to be terminated indicates objections to the president's written statement and requests a review, the president will appoint a faculty committee consisting of a minimum of five tenured faculty members from a slate of ten tenured faculty members proposed by the Faculty Senate. That committee will conduct a hearing on the proposed termination and report its findings and recommendations to the president. The president, in writing and within a reasonable time, will inform the faculty member that the decision for termination stands or has been altered. The president's decision is subject to appeal to the chancellor and the Tennessee Board of Regents as provided in the TBR Policy on Appeals and Appearances Before the Board , No. 1:02:11:00. When tenured faculty are terminated for curricular reasons, their positions will not be filled by others with the same areas of specialization for at least three years unless those terminated are offered written reappointment to their position at the previous rank and salary. Appropriate increases will be given which, in the opinion of the president, would constitute the raises that would have been awarded during the period not employed at The University of Memphis. If termination of tenured faculty is necessary for curricular reasons, the president's decision as to which faculty should be terminated will be based on an assessment of what is least seriously compromising to the University's educational programs. Termination for curricular reasons presumes a staffing pattern that cannot be warranted either by comparison with general load practices within the institution or by comparison with faculty loads in comparable departments or divisions at similar institutions. In that light, the president will also, at his or her discretion, base a decision on a careful assessment of the impact of the curricular reason on staffing requirements in the division or department as compared to overall patterns in the institution and to comparable departments or divisions in institutions similar to The University of Memphis. Unless the president demonstrates (preferably by means of past performance 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]evaluations) that an exception should be made to protect the quality of an educational program, the following considerations should be used as a guide. These, however, are not considered to be mandatory in determining the order of faculty reductions in a department or division. Tenured faculty should have priority over part-time faculty, temporary faculty, and tenure-track faculty in the probationary period. Tenured faculty with higher rank should have priority over those with lower rank.Tenured faculty with appropriate higher academic degree (s) should have priority over those with lower degrees. Tenured faculty with greater seniority in rank should normally have priority over those with less seniority. DefinitionsProgram is deleted from the curriculum means that the Tennessee Board of Regents has taken formal action to terminate a degree major, concentration, or other curricular component and, therefore, reduces or eliminates the need for faculty qualified in that area of specialization. Substantive and continued reduction of student enrollment in a field means that, over a period of at least three years, student enrollment in a field has decreased at a rate considerably higher than that of the institution as a whole. In addition, the decrease has left faculty-student ratios that, in the opinion of the president, cannot be justified either by comparison with similar load practices at the University of Memphis, or in comparison with similar institutions chosen by the president. When tenured faculty are to be terminated for curricular reasons, the president will make every possible effort to relocate them in existing vacant positions for which they are qualified. If, in the opinion of the president, relocation within the institution is a viable alternative, the University of Memphis has an obligation to provide significant effort to relocate the faculty member, including reasonable retraining costs. The final decision on relocation is within the discretion of the president. When relocation within the institution is not possible, or the faculty member involved desires to go elsewhere, the university will make every reasonable effort to assist in relocation. Termination for Adequate Cause Faculty with tenure, or faculty members on tenure-track appointments, may be terminated prior to the end of the term of appointment for adequate cause. Adequate cause is defined as: 1. Incompetence or dishonesty in teaching or research 2. Willful failure to perform the duties and responsibilities for which the faculty member was employed; or refusal or continued failure to comply with the policies of the Tennessee Board Regents, the university, or department; or to carry out specific assignments, when these policies or assignments are reasonable and nondiscriminatory. 3. Conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude 4. Improper use of narcotics or intoxicants which substantially impairs fulfillment of departmental or institutional duties and responsibilities. 5. Capricious disregard of accepted standards of professional conduct 6. Falsification of information on an employment application, curriculum vitae, or 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]other information concerning qualifications for a position. 7. Failure to maintain the level of professional excellence and ability demonstrated by other members of the faculty in the department or division of the university. NOTE: The above listed grounds for "termination for adequate cause" are defined by state law at Tennessee Code Annotated 49-8-302. The University is committed to fulfillment of the Post Tenure Evaluation and Faculty Development prior to invoking either Provision 1 (incompetence in teaching portion only) or Provision 7 as grounds for termination for cause. Procedures for Termination for Adequate Cause Termination of a faculty member who has tenure or is on tenure-track prior to the end of the annual specified term of the appointment is subject to the following procedures. 1. No termination shall be effective until steps 4 through 10 below have been completed.2. Suspensions pending termination shall be governed by the following procedure. a. A faculty member may not be suspended pending completion of steps 4 through 10 unless it is determined by the institution that the faculty member's presence poses a danger to persons or property or a threat of destruction to the academic or operational processes of the institution. Reassignment of responsibilities is not considered suspension; however, the faculty member must be reassigned responsibilities for which he/she is qualified. b. In any case of suspension, the faculty member shall be given an opportunity at the time of the decision or immediately thereafter to contest the suspension; and, if there are disputed issues of fact or cause and effect, the faculty member shall be provided the opportunity for a hearing on the suspension as soon as possible at which time the faculty member may cross-examine his/her accuser, present witnesses on his/her behalf, and be represented by an attorney. Thereafter, whether the suspension is upheld or revoked, the matter shall proceed pursuant to these procedures. 3. Except for such simple announcements as may be required concerning the time of proceedings and similar matters, public statements and publicity about these proceedings by either the faculty member or administrative officers will be avoided so far as possible until the proceedings have been completed, including consideration by the Board. 4. Upon a recommendation by the provost to the president or upon a decision by the president that these procedures should be undertaken in consideration of the termination of a tenured faculty member, one or more appropriate administrators shall meet privately with the faculty member for purposes of attempting to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the problems giving rise to the proposed termination proceedings.5. If a mutual resolution is not reached under step 4, the president shall appoint a faculty committee consisting of tenured faculty members, whose appointments should be, but are not required to be, agreed to by the faculty member. The faculty committee shall conduct an informal inquiry of the facts giving rise to the proposed termination and seek a mutually acceptable resolution. Should no such resolution be reached, the committee shall recommend to the president whether in its opinion further proceedings should be taken in pursuit of the termination. The recommendation shall be in writing 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]and shall be accompanied by reasons for the recommendation. The committee's recommendation shall not be binding on the president. 6. If no mutually acceptable resolution is reached through step 5 and/or if after consideration of the faculty committee's recommendation the president determines that further proceedings are warranted to consider termination, the following steps shall be taken.a. The faculty member shall be provided with a written statement of the specific charges alleged by the institution which constitute grounds for termination and a notice of hearing specifying the time, date, and place of the hearing. The statement and notice must be provided at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. The faculty member shall respond to the charges in writing at least five (5) days prior to the hearing. The faculty member may waive the hearing by execution of a written waiver. b. A committee consisting of members of faculty or faculty and administration shall be appointed to hear the case and to determine if adequate cause for termination exists according to the procedure hereinafter described. The committee shall be appointed by the president and the Faculty Senate, assembly or advisory committee, with each appointing the number of members designated by the policy of the institution. The committee may not include any member of the faculty committee referred to in 5 above. Members deeming themselves disqualified for bias or interest shall remove themselves from the case, either at the request of a party or on their own initiative. Members of the committee shall not discuss the case outside committee deliberations and shall report any ex-parte communication pertaining to the hearing to the president who shall notify all parties of the communication. 7. The hearing committee shall elect a chairperson who shall direct the proceedings and rule on procedural matters, including the granting of reasonable extensions of time at the request of any party and upon the showing of good cause for the extension. 8. The chairperson of the hearing committee may in his/her discretion require a joint prehearing conference with the parties which may be held in person or by a conference telephone call. The purpose of the pre-hearing conference should include but is not limited to one or more of the following: a. Notification as to procedure for conducting the hearing. b. Exchange of witness lists, documentary evidence, and affidavits. c. Define and clarify issues. d. Present stipulations of fact. A written memorandum of the pre-hearing conference should be prepared and provided to each party. 9. A hearing shall be conducted by the hearing committee to determine whether adequate cause for termination of the faculty member exists. The hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures below. a. During the hearing, the faculty member will be permitted to have an academic advisor present and may be represented by legal counsel of his/her choice. b. A verbatim record of the hearing will be taken and a typewritten copy will be made 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 4 - Tenure and Promotion - The University of 4:13:36 PM]available to the faculty member, upon request, at the faculty member's expense. c. The burden of proof that adequate cause exists rests with the institution and shall be satisfied only by clear and convincing evidence in the record considered as a whole. d. The faculty member will be afforded an opportunity to obtain necessary witnesses and documentary or other evidence. The administration will cooperate with the committee in securing witnesses and making available documentary and other evidence that is under its control. e. The faculty member and the administration will have the right to confront and crossexamine all witnesses. Where the witnesses cannot or will not appear, but the committee determines that the interests of justice require admission of their statements, the committee will identify the witnesses, disclose their statements, and, if possible, provide for interrogatories. An affidavit may be submitted in lieu of the personal appearance of a witness if the party offering the affidavit has provided a copy to the opposing party at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing and the opposing party has not objected to the admission of the affidavit in writing within (7) days after delivery of the affidavit or if the committee chairperson determines that the admission of the affidavit is necessary to ensure a just and fair decision. f. In a hearing on charges of incompetence, the testimony shall include that of qualified faculty members from the institution or other institutions of higher education. g. The hearing committee will not be bound by strict rules of legal evidence and may admit any evidence which is of probative value in determining the issues involved. Every possible effort will be made to obtain the most reliable evidence available. h. The findings of fact and the report will be based solely on the hearing record. i. The president and the faculty member will be provided a copy of the written committee report. The committee's written report shall specify findings of fact and shall state whether the committee has determined that adequate cause for termination exists and, if so, the specific grounds for termination found. In addition, the committee may recommend action less than dismissal. The report shall also specify any applicable policy the committee considered. 10. After consideration of the committee's report and the record, the president may in his/ her discretion consult with the faculty member prior to reaching a final decision regarding termination. Following his/her review, the president shall notify the faculty member of his/her decision, which, if contrary to the committee's recommendation shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons. If the faculty member is terminated or suspended as a result of the president's decision, the faculty member may appeal the president's action to the Chancellor pursuant to TBR Policy 1:02:11:00. Review of the appeal shall be based upon the record of hearing. If upon review of the record, the Chancellor notes objections regarding the termination and/or its proceedings, the matter will be returned to the president for reconsideration, taking into account the stated objections, and, at the discretion of the president, the case may be returned to the hearing committee for further proceedings. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]2011 Faculty Handbook Chapter 5 - Instruction ContentsAcademic Instruction Textbooks and Faculty-Produced Instructional Materials Academic Dishonesty Academic Advising Confidentiality of Student Records (The Buckley Amendment) Classroom Misconduct Grading System Class Rolls Faculty Teaching Loads Course Introduction and Syllabus Class Attendance and Grading Office Hours Faculty Meetings Faculty Absences Inclement Weather and Emergency Closings Veterans' and Athletes' Progress Reports ExaminationsCommencementSources of Student Support Academic Instruction Textbooks and Faculty- Produced Instructional MaterialsThe selection of textbooks is a departmental function.

The purchase of these materials must also be approved by the department chair and, in the case of materials de signed only for University of Memphis audiences, the dean. The dean will approve the selection process to assure its objectivity. In addition, anyone preparing materials to be copyrighted and designed only for a University of Memphis audience must obtain advance approval to avoid possible financial loss and must comply with Policy UM1607- Intellectual Property. rn 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]Faculty-authored material that students are required to purchase may not be sold directly to students by a faculty member, department, or college, but must be available for purchase at established outlets, including the University Bookstore. Academic Dishonesty The University of Memphis Code of Student Conduct defines academic misconduct as all acts of cheating and plagiarism. Academic Dishonesty is defined and maintained on the Office of Judicial and Ehtical Programs website at Process Faculty, teaching assistants, and staff are encouraged to contact the Office of Judicial and Ethical Programs if they suspect dishonesty to discuss various responses under University policies. See also the Code of Student Conduct in the Student Handbook at stuhand2/. As a first step, a faculty member may meet with the student to determine if an actual violation has occurred. Faculty may also take the following actions. Request for hearing A faculty member who has good cause to believe a student has engaged in academic misconduct may request a hearing of the allegation of academic misconduct by contacting the chair of the Academic Discipline Committee or the University judicial officer. A student found guilty of academic misconduct by the Academic Discipline Committee may be awarded a grade of "F" for the course, assignment, or examination at issue, and is also subject to additional disciplin ary sanctions including suspension or expulsion. A hearing before the Academic Discipline Committee is conducted under the procedures provided in the Code for Student Conduct. The committee members are faculty and students appointed annually by the president. Summary Discipline A faculty member who has good cause to believe that a student has engaged in academic misconduct may choose to exercise summary discipline as outlined below. A student's grade in the course, assignment, or examination affected by the alleged academic misconduct may be lowered to any extent, including a grade of "F." If a faculty member exercises summary discipline, the faculty member must notify the appropriate department chair of the action. The department chair will notify the student of the action in writing and advise the student of the right to appeal the summary discipline to the Academic Discipline Committee. Student Appeal of Summary Discipline: a student may appeal an exercise of sum marydiscipline by a faculty member to the Academic Discipline Committee. Multiple Acts of Academic Misconduct Any student who receives more than one "F" as a result of summary discipline by a faculty member may be summoned to appear before the Academic Discipline Committee and may be subject to additional sanctions, including suspension or expulsion. A decision of the Academic Discipline Committee may be appealed by the student to the University Appeals Committee. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]SanctionsIn addition to receiving a lower grade on an assignment or in the course, the following sanctions may be imposed by the Academic Discipline Committee upon any student found to have engaged in academic dishonesty. Probation. Probation is for a designated period of time and includes the probability of more severe disciplinary sanctions if the student is found to be violating any institutional regulation(s) during the probationary period. Loss of Privileges. Denial of specified privileges for a designated period of time.Discretionary sanctions. Work assignments, service to the University or other related discretionary assignments. University suspension. Separation of the student from the University for a definite period of time, after which the student is eligible to return. Conditions for readmission may be specified. University expulsion. Permanent separation of the student from the University. Academic Advising The University of Memphis is committed to quality academic advising that fosters student growth and development. Quality advising helps students understand the aims and purposes of higher education; provides information and resources concerning the University's pro gram, opportunities, and requirements; and helps students identify their educational and career goals. Faculty advisors have the following responsibilities:Keep up-to-date files on advisees Provide accurate academic information about course offerings, departmental policies, degree requirements, study habits, grade point averages, graduate study opportunities, and career choices related to the major Post regular office hours and seek to be flexible and reasonable to individual needsEncourage advisees to review their progress toward degree completion to assure early detection of problems Advising assistance is available from the college-level advisor or degree analyst. A handbook designed to assist advisors is available in each department chair's office and also in Academic Affairs. For graduate advisors, the Graduate Coordinator's Handbook is available in each departmental graduate coordinator's office. Advising Student Organizations Faculty members are at times asked to serve as advisors to honorary, leadership, and recognition societies, professional organizations, social fraternities and sororities, and special interest groups (e.g., political, religious, athletic), each of which is expected to have a faculty or administrative advisor. Advisors generally work with organizations on matters such as leadership, finance, and general operations. In addition, faculty advisors are expected to keep up-to-date records and sign for the expenditures from student activity fees. Further informa tion for faculty is available from the Office of Student Organizations. Confidentiality of Student It is the policy of the Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Memphis to 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]Records (The Buckley Amendment)comply with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (also called FERPA or the Buckley Amendment). The Buckley Amendment was designed to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable educational records of students and former students. Each faculty and staff member employed by the University of Memphis is individually responsible for complying with its provisions. Full guidelines are available in the Office of the Registrar and departmental offices or on the U. S. Department of Education web site ( ). Violations of the Buckley Amendment may subject a faculty or staff member to disciplinary action. According to the Buckley Amendment: Students have the right to see their records, except where the right has been waived or where the record contains confidential letters or recommendations placed there prior to January 1, 1975. Information should not be released from the student's records to persons other than the student; parents do not have the right to see a student's records except when the student is a dependent as defined by law. Faculty members should refer requests for access to informa tion to the University Registrar. When returning any graded material to students, faculty members should be careful not to allow the grades to be seen by anyone other than the student receiving them. Faculty members should not post grades without the written permission of the student. Classroom Misconduct Faculty have ultimate control over classroom behavior and may eject from the classroom any student engaged in disruptive or violent conduct. Disruptive conduct includes conduct that intentionally interferes with normal classroom procedure or presentation of the instructor or other student(s), with academic evaluation, or with another student's right to pursue course work. Classroom misconduct also includes any physical abuse or threat of abuse that is dangerous to the health, safety, or well-being of the instructor or other students whether on or off campus as related to classroom procedure or academic evaluation (UofM Policy No. I:2E:00:05). Faculty must report any incident to the University judicial officer and the department chair. The University judicial officer will meet with the instructor and the chair to determine the appropriate action before the next class period. If there is disagreement as to readmission, the student will be excluded from the classroom pending a hearing. If there is agreement for readmission, the student will be readmitted subject to any restrictions or discipline prescribed by the University judicial officer. When it is determined that the student should not be readmitted, or where there is disagreement, the University judicial officer will arrange a hearing. The hearing should be before the dean of the college where the incident occurred or a designee, the University judicial officer or a designee, and a student appointed by the president. The purpose of the hearing will be to determine whether the student will be readmitted to the classroom. The hearing must be conducted within five class days under the procedures set forth in the Code of Student Conduct. An appeal to the president is available.When a student is readmitted and circumstances warrant, the University judicial officer may initiate formal disciplinary charges as set forth in the section entitled "The 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]Code of Student Conduct Hearing Procedures" in the Code of Student Conduct. Grading System GradingEvaluation of student work at the University of Memphis is expressed by letters, which are converted to numbers (quality points) for the purposes of averaging grades. Grades and Quality Points are maintained in the Registrar's Office and can be found at Notes1. This grading system does not apply to the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law. 2. The audit grade (AD) is posted on a student record only if a faculty member judges that a student has attended enough classes to earn the notation. Audit students should be informed at the beginning of the semester that the AD notation will be based only on attendance since university policy restricts audit students from participation in the class.3. The grade of Incomplete (I) indicates that a student has not completed a course for some unavoidable reason that the instructor has found acceptable. Unless the student completes the requirements for removal of "I" within 45 days (90 days for graduate courses) from the end of the semester or summer session in which it was received, the grade will be changed to "F". Extensions may be granted if the instructor's absence from the campus makes it impossible for a student to remove the "I" or in other circumstances acceptable to the instructor. A grade other than "I" or "IP" ("in progress" for graduate courses) may not be changed as the result of additional work after a grade has been submitted to the Registrar's Office. Grades may be appealed, as described below. Grade Reporting Approximately a week before the end of each term, faculty will be notified to record final grades. Grades are due within 44 hours after the last examination. A grade of 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]"F" must be assigned to students who begin attendance, stop attending, and failed to withdraw; faculty must also report the last date of known attendance for these students. The date of last attendance may be based on the last test taken or last assignment submitted if class attendance is not a requirement. Safeguarding and Retaining Grades Faculty members are responsible for insuring the documentation of students' standing in classes throughout the semester. At a minimum, a duplicate grade record should be stored in an alternate location, and the department chair should be notified of that location. This will insure that grades are protected in the event of the death or serious illness of the instructor, or a natural disaster destroys the original grade book, test papers, or other documentation. Faculty should keep the records on which final grades are based for at least twelve months. Term papers and examinations may be returned to students, but a record of scores used to calculate the final grade should be maintained. Posting Grades Faculty should post grades in the myMemphis portal as instructed on the Registrar's website at Grades are available to students on-their student portal page within two to three days after they are reported to the Registrar's Office. Withholding Grade Reports Tennessee law requires the University to withhold grade reports, transcripts, and diplomas from students who have financial obligations to the university. Faculty members should check with the Registrar's Office before furnishing anyone with a written certification of final grades. Grade Changes Once grades are submitted to the Registrar's Office, they can be changed only by the faculty member except as provided for in the Grade Appeals Procedure. Grades other than I and IP may not be changed after they are submitted solely on the basis of additional work by students. Grade changes for undergraduate courses are made in writing by faculty through the department chair to the Registrar's Office (Corrections). Grade changes for graduate courses must be made in writing to the dean of the Graduate School. Undergraduate Grade Appeals The undergraduate grade appeal procedure is designed to provide any undergraduate student at The University of Memphis with a clearly defined avenue for appealing the assignment of a course grade that a student believes was based on prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or other reasons not related to academic performance. In all cases the complaining student has the burden of proof with respect to the allegations in the complaint and in the request for a hearing. Students pursuing the appeals procedure must follow steps one through three listed below and file for a hearing in accordance with the following time limits. Grade appeals for the fall semester must be filed in the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs by March 15 following the semester in which the grade was earned. Grade appeals for the spring or summer semesters must be filed in the Office of the Vice Provost for 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]Undergraduate Programs by October 15 of the same year. If a student fails to pursue the procedure within the time limits, the disposition of the student's complaint made in the previous step becomes final. If the dean or chair fails to respond to the student's complaint within the time limits, the Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee will act on the student's complaint. The procedure is terminated if the student and the instructor agree on the grade or if the student fails to appeal a decision within the appropriate time limit. All correspondence and records will be retained in the office in which the complaint is terminated. Step 1. The student will first consult with the instructor in an effort to provide a satisfactory resolution of the complaint. In the event the student cannot schedule a meeting with the instructor, the student may contact the department chair, who will schedule the meeting between the student and the instructor. The only exception to this procedure is the case where the instructor has been terminated by the university or is unavailable, so that it is impossible to complete Step 1. Step 2. If the complaint is not resolved in Step 1, the student may present the complaint in writing to the chair of the department in which the course was offered. In consultation with the instructor and the student, the department chair will attempt to resolve the complaint within a fifteen (15) day period dating from the formal presentation of the written complaint. The department chair may counsel with faculty of the department. If the department chair was the instructor or if for any reason the chair disqualifies herself or himself, the student may proceed to Step 3. The student's grade may be changed in Step 2 by the written consent of the instructor and the student.Step 3. If the complaint cannot be resolved at the level of Step 2 within the prescribed fifteen (15) day period, the student may appeal further by presenting to the dean of the college a written statement that clearly explains the basis of the appeal (prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or other reasons not related to academic performance), the evidence for this appeal, and any supporting data. The chair must also forward a copy of all correspondence and records to the dean. The dean may utilize any resources available to the dean's office to resolve the grade conflict within a fifteen (15) day period. If the dean finds that the request does not have merit, the dean will so notify the student, the instructor, and the chair. If the dean and the chair are in agreement that the grade should be changed, either raised or lowered, the dean will be empowered to change the grade without the instructor's consent; otherwise the grade will remain as recorded. Either the student or the instructor may appeal the dean's decision made under Step 3 by filing a written request in the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs for a hearing before the University Grade Appeals Committee within the time limit set forth above. In the event of such an appeal, the decision will be stayed, pending the completion of the procedure in Step 4. The dean must be pro vided a copy of the hearing request. Step 4. The person requesting a hearing before the University Grade Appeals Committee must complete a grade appeal form provided by the Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs by March 15 for grades earned the preceding fall semester and by October 15 for grades earned the preceding spring and summer semesters. All supporting documents should be included with this form at the time of submission. The vice provost for academic affairs will forward the request to the chair of the undergraduate grade appeal committee. The chair will subsequently distribute copies of the request to the members of the committee for consider ation. If the committee finds that the student's or the instructor's request merits a hearing, the committee will notify the student, the instructor, the chair, and the college dean of the 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]time and location of the hearing. If the committee finds that the request does not merit a hearing, the student and the instructor are to be notified in writing. The University Grade Appeals Commit tee will function as a review board and has the power to allow the assigned grade to stand or to raise or lower the assigned grade. Its decision must be formally announced, in writing, to all parties. The decision of the University Grade Appeals Committee will be final. The University Grade Appeals Committee will be composed of seven members and seven alternates as follows: A chair designated by the vice provost for academic affairs, a faculty member and alternate designated by the dean of the college involved, two faculty members and two alternates elected by the Faculty Senate, one student and one alternate from the college involved, and two students and two alternates selected through the Student Government Association. Although the primary responsibility of the committee is to review appeals, the committee will report any obvious discriminatory or capricious conduct on the part of either the student or the instructor to the appropriate vice provost for consideration and action. Graduate Grade and Retention Appeal Procedures These appeal procedures are designed to provide any graduate student with a clearly defined avenue for appealing the assignment of a course grade by an instructor or dismissal from a graduate program. Both appeals procedures, grade appeals and retention appeals, are specifically designed to review a decision that the graduate student believes to be based on prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or other reasons not related to academic performance. In all cases the complaining students have the burden of proof with respect to the allegations in the complaint and in the request for a hearing. The graduate grade appeal procedure begins in the department with the course instructor. If the dispute is not resolved with the course instructor, the student then obtains a Graduate Grade Appeal Form in the Graduate School Office (also available online at in order to continue the appeal. The grade appeal procedure is a four-step process that may result in a hearing before the Graduate Grade Appeals Committee. For details of the graduate grade appeal procedure, see the graduate bulletin. The retention appeal procedure begins with a student requesting from the department chair, in writing, a review of the dismissal from a program. The retention appeal is a four-step procedure that may result in a hearing before the University Council for Graduate Studies and Research. For details of the graduate retention appeal procedure, see the graduate bulletin. Class Rolls Students may not attend classes unless they are properly enrolled. A class attendance worksheet is sent to all faculty for the first class session to record each student's initial attendance. Students attending class, but who are not listed on the attendance worksheet, are required to process a "late add" in their dean's office. The names of students who have not attended any class for the first two weeks of the regular semester, or the first week for shorter sessions, must be reported to the Registrar's Office. Following the last day to add classes, faculty are sent verification rosters of all students officially enrolled in their classes. Faculty with Student Information System (Banner) access may print or download "real-time" class lists at any time. Students are allowed to drop classes up through approximately mid session. Instructions for copying a class list into a spreadsheet for a grade book are available at 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM] Faculty Teaching Loads Each semester, the chairs face a significant number of challenges in balancing the needs of their departments. It is the chairs responsibility to ensure that teaching and service loads are equitably distributed among the faculty, allowing research-active faculty adequate time in which to carry out their research. Simultaneously, the chair has to respond to the demands placed upon the department: e.g., the number of general education classes to be taught, the number of majors to be supported, the number of faculty vacancies to be filled, the number of graduate programs to be supported, the amount of part-time money that is available, and so forth). In balancing the needs of the department, the chairs should use the following general guidelines:It is appropriate to base teaching loads upon departmental and disciplinary criteria and upon the amount of documented research and/or service activity of the faculty member. It is generally inappropriate to assign the same teaching loads to all faculty. The amount of research and/or service activity must be taken into account. Tenured and tenure-track faculty should be strongly encouraged to teach lower division courses. The preponderance of course-hours should be taught by tenured and tenure-track faculty.Teaching load discussions should take place during the faculty members annual evaluation period. Course Introduction and SyllabusAt the first meeting of a class, faculty should discuss the specific objectives of the course; outline the topics to be studied; announce the number and nature of required reports, experi ments, and tests; and explain the means that will be used to evaluate students' work. This information should be included in a course syllabus distributed to the class. For undergradu ate classes, the attendance policy (see below) should also be described.Class Attendance and GradingAt their discretion, faculty may use class attendance in determining grades. If attendance is used, a complete written statement of the attendance policy that details the weight of atten dance in determining the final grade must be given along with the course syllabus to students present at the first and second meetings of the class. Medical Absences. Student Health Services does not document medical absences for students. If a medical excuse is required as part of a class attendance policy, students must obtain this service at another health facility. Office Hours Faculty members are expected to establish, publicize, and maintain scheduled office hours during which they are available to students for conferences and special instruction. Specific policies regarding office hours are set within individual departments. These policies are applicable to those teaching the summer session as well as in the regular semesters. See also UofM Policy UM 1286 - Faculty Office Hours). 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]Faculty Meetings Meetings of the University faculty are called by the president, provost or a designated representative and the dates are published in the bulletins. Faculty are expected to attend these meetings. College meetings are called by the deans, who will announce times and locations. Faculty Absences A faculty member who must be absent from a class for any reason is responsible for seeing that the class receives instruction. For an anticipated absence the faculty member will propose a plan to the department chair, who will notify the college dean. If the absence is unanticipated, the chair will make emergency arrangements and notify the college dean as soon as practicable. For a prolonged absence necessitating the employment of a substitute teacher, the faculty member and department chair must make arrangements with the college dean and the provost. See also the section of this Handbook on sick leave and Policy UM1544 - Sick Leave and Bereavement Leave. Inclement Weather and Emergency Closings When inclement weather or other emergency situations make driving hazardous, university officials may curtail all operations until conditions improve. Unless and until an official closing announcement is issued by local news media, faculty members are expected to hold classes as usual. Questions regarding cancellation of classes or curtailing of operations should be addressed to the department chair or call the emergency hotline 901-678-0888. Reference: and Athletes' Progress Reports The University is required to submit to the Veterans Administration information regarding class attendance and participation of veterans and dependents receiving benefits. Twice a semester and once during each summer term, faculty are asked to complete and return forms to the Office of Veterans Services for students enrolled in their classes. Reference: Center for Athletic Academic Services asks faculty approximately twice a semester for progress reports of athletes in their classes. The Center provides counseling, tutoring, scheduling assistance, career planning, and special services for all University of Memphis student athletes. Reference: ExaminationsThe schedule of final examinations is published in the Schedule of Classes each semester. Examinations are to start promptly at the designated times and may not extend beyond the period indicated (two hours for the fall and spring semesters, ninety minutes for the summer terms). Faculty members may not give examinations at a time other than the scheduled one, except with written permission from the department chair and college dean. Make-up examinations may be given after the scheduled time to students who have been absent and who are able to justify their absence. A student who is absent from the final examination without permission of the faculty member incurs a grade of F and may, depending on the weight of the examination in determining the final grade, incur a grade of F for the course. CommencementThe University's annual commencement consists of three convocations: spring (May), summer (August), and winter (December). At least one-fourth of all full-time faculty members in each department are to participate in the spring and winter convocations; in the summer, one-fourth of the faculty who teach in the second term, plus the chair 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 5 - Instruction - The University of 4:13:38 PM]or a designee, are to participate. Selection of participants is the responsibility of the department chair. At least six weeks prior to each convocation, the chair will furnish the director of commencement with their names. Academic regalia should be ordered at least one month before the convocation through the Commencement Office. Sources of Student Support The Academic Common Market The Academic Common Market is designed to allow students from southern states to pay state tuition while attending the University of Memphis.

Bloodbornepathogens training is available from Environmental Health and Safety. A model exposure control plan that can be customized to individual work areas is available from Environmental Health and Safety at Agents, Stocks, and Cultures The University's Biological Safety Program ( serves as policy for the possession, storage, and use of biological agents. This program is designed around CDC/NIH guidelines and is considered to be a minimum standard of care. Recombinant DNA Molecules 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 6 - Research and Service - The University of 4:13:39 PM]All research conducted at or sponsored by the University, irrespective of the source of funding, shall adhere to the recombinant DNA guidelines set forth by the most recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules.All recombinant DNA protocols must be submitted to Environmental Health and Safety using the registration form for recombinant DNA research. Those protocols requiring committee approval will be forwarded to the University Biosafety Committee.Radioisotopes The University's Radiation Safety Committee governs the possession and use of radioactive materials and other sources of ionizing radiation within the University. Research personnel using radioactive materials are expected to be familiar with and operate within the policies and procedures outlined in the University Radiation Safety Program found at departments are responsible for maintaining the departments' radioactive materials licenses and for ensuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Responsible users bear primary responsibility for the proper use and storage of radioactive materials and radiation-producing devices within their areas, including the execution of area surveys and recordkeeping requirements. Environmental Health and Safety provides personnel dosimetry services and offers a radiation safety training program leading to certification as an authorized user. Dosimetry services can be initiated by contacting the Radiation Safety Officer. Lasers Research personnel who may be exposed to class 2, class 3, and/or class 4 laser radiation are expected to familiarize themselves with and follow the requirements of ANSI Z136.6-2000 ( Safe Use of Lasers ). A laser safety checklist is available at and can assist laboratories in meeting the requirements of this standard. Hazardous Waste, Biological Waste, and Radioactive Waste Each department is fully responsible for ensuring proper management and disposal of its chemical, biological, and radioactive waste streams. Individual researchers are responsible for complying with applicable waste disposal laws/regulations and with University policy. Chemical waste disposal requirements are outlined in the Guide to Hazardous Waste Management ( waste disposal assistance is available from Environmental Health and Safety for departments that generate small volumes of biological waste. Larger bio- waste generators must arrange for disposal through the University's medical waste contractor.The University's radioactive waste disposal requirements can be found in the Radiation Safety Program at wastes (radioactive waste combined with hazardous and/or infectious waste) 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 6 - Research and Service - The University of 4:13:39 PM]are especially difficult to dispose of; therefore, every effort should be made to avoid creation of mixed wastes. Personnel who consider implementation of protocols that generate mixed wastes should contact Environmental Health and Safety prior to beginning such programs. Shipping and Receiving Hazardous Materials All University personnel who ship or otherwise impact the transportation of hazardous materials, including hazardous chemicals, biological agents, and radiological materials, must be trained and certified prior to engaging in such activities. University policy regarding the shipment of hazardous materials can be found at Agents and Toxins Federal anti-terrorism laws and regulations restrict possession, use, and transfer of biological agents and toxins of high consequence. Penalties of up to five (5) years imprisonment and/or $500,000 in fines may be levied on individuals and organizations found to be in violation. All researchers anticipating the procurement, possession, use, transfer or destruction of select agents must contact Environmental Health and Safety prior to the event to ensure that applicable regulations are followed. A complete list of CDC select agents can be found at Decommissioning Any laboratory or other area where chemical, biological, or radiological materials have been used or stored must be decommissioned prior to closing. Typically,decommissioning occurs prior to a researcher leaving the University, relocating to another laboratory space, renovation of a laboratory, or retirement of research pursuits. Environmental Health and Safety should be contacted for guidance. Service - Consulting Recognizing that the professional qualifications of faculty have great value in areas beyond normal University assignments and that services (to students, colleagues, and citizens of the surrounding areas) are enhanced by participation in activities beyond the campus, the University of Memphis encourages its faculty to undertake consulting and similar external employment for which they are qualified and that does not interfere with University responsibilities. Professional experiences beyond the classroom can contribute to the quality of instruction, increase professional competence and reputation, and bring credit to the University. By providing valuable services to a varied constituency, both public and private, faculty can help to create important links between the University and the area it serves. Although these services are encouraged within regulatory limits, it is not proper for a Univer sity employee to provide private consulting services to external organizations when those services might be in conflict or competition with services offered by the University itself. To comply with guidelines approved by the Tennessee Board of Regents, The University of Memphis has formulated a policy (UofM Policy No. 1490) that provides both encouragement and supervision for those engaged in outside employment. This policy does not apply to: 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 6 - Research and Service - The University of 4:13:39 PM]normal, short-term professional activities such as participation in symposia, accreditation visits, speaking engagements, exhibitions or recitals, even though honoria may be received for such participation; or activities carried on outside the contract period term or while on leave from the University.The term outside employment includes consulting and any other external activity for which there is remuneration. Prior to undertaking any outside employment, faculty will notify their department chair of the nature of the employment and the expected commitment of time. The chair will determine whether the proposed employment is consistent with the University of Memphis policies and the Tennessee Board of Regents as outlined below. If the decision is that the employment is inconsistent with these policies, a faculty member may appeal through the normal institutional channels for handling grievances. Before faculty members begin outside employment they must obtain the written approval of the department chair and dean on a form (see attachment to UofM Policy No. 1490) that states the nature of the employment and the time required. If the chair does not approve the proposed employment, the faculty member may seek approval from the dean of the college. Further appeal may be made as outlined in the grievance procedures. When seeking approval, faculty members should submit separate forms for each type of service requiring a major commitment of time. A similar service rendered to several clients may be shown on a single form if each client requires only a minor commitment of time, as in many instances of professional consulting, private lessons, tax preparation, etc. University property and facilities (e.g., offices, equipment, telephones, computer services, etc.) may not be used in outside employment unless the use has been approved. If such arrangements are approved, compensation to the University may be required at rates established by the University. University titles, offices, addresses, and telephone numbers may not be used in city directories for the purpose of publicizing non-University interests. The University cannot assume any responsibility for private consulting services entered into by members of its faculty or staff. Consultants must make clear to any employer the fact that the work to be performed has no official connection with the University. Outside employment that involves other agencies of state government (including institutions of higher education) is subject to prior approval by both the president of the university , or a designee, and the appropriate representative of the other agency (see UofM Procedure No. UM 1490). In these cases, the two institutions will execute a dual services agreement. Outside employment must not result in any conflict of interest and must not interfere with any University teaching, research, or service assignments. If outside employment conflicts with a faculty member's teaching schedule, specific arrangements for the classes must be approved by the department chair. Teaching, research, or service assignments should not be made principally for the convenience of faculty (or staff) members wishing to engage in outside employment.Administrative officers, including department chairs, may not employ (through outside consulting or business activities) or be employed by a faculty or staff member over whom they have direct supervision. Exceptions must be approved by the president or the administra tive officer's immediate superior. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 6 - Research and Service - The University of 4:13:39 PM]Centers of Excellence The University of Memphis has been designated by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission as the location for centers of excellence in a number of areas.

Guidelines and the application form are available on-line at the Research Support Services website: . 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 7 - Professional Development and Awards - The University of 4:13:39 PM]Academic Enrichment Program In addition to the funds specifically allocated to departments, divisions, and colleges for their traditional academic programs, the University maintains a special fund to support activities recommended and designed by faculty, staff, and students as complements to usual offerings. Some are departmental in scope, some college-wide, and others involve the entire commu nity. Artists-in-residence, distinguished lecture series, conferences, and symposia are examples of programs supported with these funds. The planning and coordination of requests for support originate with the college deans, to whom inquiries and suggestions should be directed. Advanced Learning Center Advanced Learning Center provides services to support teaching and research. Among the consultation services available to support teaching are discussion of instructional issues, observation of classroom teaching, video-taping teaching, collection of mid-semester feedback from students, conduct of classroom research, workshops on a variety of teaching issues, and development of on-line coursework and or teaching tools. Travel The University provides funds to help meet the expenses of travel to professional meetings that are relative to the subject area in which a faculty member is teaching. Travel decisions are made within each department. To obtain financial support, a faculty member must submit a request to the Accounting Office through the department chair approximately two weeks in advance of the planned travel. If funds are available, the Accounting Office will approve the request and return the authorization form to the faculty member. Until this form has been received, University-supported travel will not be authorized. An advance payment may be requested. For more information, see also Policy UM1309. To obtain a copy of the form, please access this website Travel Authorization for University-supported travel to Alaska, Hawaii, and out of the country (except Canada) is subject to recommendation by the president and written, advanced approval of the Chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents. Authorizations are routed to the president by the departmental chair, dean, and provost. The Request for Overseas Travel Form is available from the Accounting Office. Requests for authorization should reach the President's Office 30 days before the date approval is needed. Travel to Canada requires the approval of the president.

Contact the Payroll Office for questions about the payment schedule and authorization or changes to direct deposit. Compensation for part-time or adjunct faculty is evenly divided into three monthly payments. Salary payments are made on the last banking day of the month. For the fall semes ter, payments are made on the last banking days of October, November, and December. For the spring semester, payments are made on the last banking days of February, March, and April. Salary for faculty who do not complete a full academic year or full semester, or who begin employment late in the semester, is prorated as follows: a. Faculty who complete one full semester will earn one-half of their academic year salary.b. When an appointment begins or ends on a date other than the beginning or end of a semester, the compensation for that part of a semester will be calculated as follows: 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 8 - Salary, Leave, and Economic Benefits - The University of 4:13:40 PM](1) Compensation will be based on the actual number of faculty workdays in the semester. These dates are established by the Provost's Office. (2) The period between fall commencement and spring registration, approved holidays, the fall break, and the spring break are excluded when calculating the number of workdays in each semester. Payments for the summer session, longevity payments, and extra compensation are included in the month-end paycheck. University faculty may authorize payroll deductions for approved charitable organizations. The United Way of the Mid-South is one of the charitable organizations approved to solicit funds on campus. Forms are made available during the annual giving campaign, usually in October. Optional payroll deductions include various insurance and retirement plans, parking fees, savings bonds, Wellness Program, Campus Recreation Center, First South Federal Credit Union, Memphis Area Teachers' Credit Union, and the University of Memphis Foundation. Extra Compensation Faculty are encouraged and expected to be involved in public service and continuing education activities offered by the University; normally these activities would be part of regular assignments. At times, however, extra compensation may be received for credit or noncredit teaching, participation in applied research, consulting, preparation of educational materials, and similar activities. See UM Policy 1490 - services must be performed in addition to the faculty member's full workload and entirely outside the scheduled work hours or while on holiday or annual leave, if applicable. These additional duties must not interfere with the performance of regularly assigned responsibilities and duties. The University of Memphis reserves the right to withhold payment for work performed when the employee fails to comply with the Extra Compensation procedure. When services are rendered by a TBR employee to another state agency, The University of Tennessee, or another TBR institution of higher education (Dual Services), extra compensation will be paid by the contracting agency to the institution pursuant to TBR Guideline G-030. Extra compensation earnings are subject to the following limits. Course Limits: Full-time faculty may not receive extra compensation for more than two credit courses per semester (T.C.A. 49-5-410). Refer to U of M Policy 1490 for rules regarding the calculation of rates per credit hour. It is faculty members' responsibility to ensure that they do not exceed any limits established by the Tennessee Board of Regents, as excess earnings are due to the University. A letter of indebtedness will be issued by Human Resources for the purpose of recouping the funds. Research Compensation Purpose 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 8 - Salary, Leave, and Economic Benefits - The University of 4:13:40 PM]The incentive pay plan seeks to reward faculty members with incentive pay up to 50% of the amount of salary recovered from external funding sources. Incentive Pay Procedure Faculty seeking incentive pay must obtain external funding for their base salary, negotiate an agreement with their chair and dean, verify work performed by signing the semester's effort certification form, and initiate payment on the end of month payroll by completing an incentive pay request form. External Funding Proposal For faculty to be eligible for incentive compensation, the external sponsor must provide funding for their base salary, all associated benefits, and the maximum Facilities and Administration (F&A also known as indirect costs) rate allowed by the sponsor's formal policy. The Vice Provost for Research has final authority over whether or not the external funding meets these criteria. In order to comply with federal cost principles in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, it is important that the cost to the external sponsor remain unchanged as a result of the incentive pay plan. In general, federal grants do not allow extra compensation to be charged directly to a federal grant. However, a percentage of the faculty member's base salary, commensurate with his/her level of effort, may be charged to the grant. Federal cost principles allow charging a percentage of base salary commensurate with the faculty's level of effort on the federal grant. Situations may arise where the external funding entity may pay extra compensation and/or incentive compensation. However, this is appropriate only if more work is performed. Faculty receiving release time to work on the externally funded project should not receive extra compensation. Faculty Incentive Pay Plan Agreement The purpose of this agreement is to create an understanding between faculty, chairs, and deans regarding the disposition of base salary budget recovered from external funding sources. For detailed information about the Research Incentive program, go to: deadline is the 5th of the month for payment on at the end of the month. The form with attachments will be reviewed and approved by the Vice Provost for Research (or designee) prior to submitting to the payroll office by the 5th of the month for payment at the end of the month. Payment of incentive compensation to faculty who have resigned must be approved by the Vice Provost for Research and the Provost. A justification memo should be prepared and routed through the chair and dean for their recommendations and comments.Retirement Benefits Retirement benefits only accrue on the first 25% of additional compensation. Incentive compensation (or a combination of incentive and extra compensation) in excess of 25% will not be reported as retirement wages. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 8 - Salary, Leave, and Economic Benefits - The University of 4:13:40 PM]SAMPLE FORM A.

Emeritus Status The honorary title of professor emeritus may be awarded by the president to faculty members who retire with the rank of instructor, assistant professor, associate professor or professor, who have completed ten years of service to the University, and who are recommended by the chair or a faculty member (s) within the department. Recommendations for emeritus status should be based upon records of teaching excellence, substantive scholar ship and meaningful service. The Departments may, if available, provide office space and other support services at their discretion. Summer Session CompensationSummer session assignments are separate from academic-year appointments and compensation is based on the prior academic-year salary. To determine summer session compensation, first multiply the prior academic-year salary by .03125, then take that result and multiply it by the total summer credit hours taught. Summer session compensation may not exceed 25% of the preceding academic-year salary nor may faculty teach more than eight (8) hours during the summer. Summer employment is by invitation and contingent on instructional needs of the department and the University. Faculty should be aware that summer session classes will be cancelled unless they meet minimum enrollment standards established by the University. Any summer earnings in excess of the 25% limit will be recouped from future earnings. See UofM Procedure 1493 - InsuranceFull-time faculty members are eligible, though not required, to participate in the State of Tennessee Group Insurance Program, including health, life, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance. Applications and detailed information concerning insurance coverage are available in the Department of Human Resources or at Leaves without Pay Faculty may apply for leave without pay for a period not to exceed one year. Requests should be addressed to the department chair, and then forwarded to the dean, provost, and finally to the president for approval. Requests for leaves exceeding one year must be approved by the chancellor. Leaves without pay are not counted in fulfillment of the probation period for tenure. Nontenured faculty members generally will not be recommended for a leave of absence. See also Policy UM1572 - Sick Leave Full-time faculty members earn sick leave at the rate of 7.5 hours per month for the nine month academic year. In the case of illness, all accrued sick leave hours must be used before a leave of absence without pay will be considered. Sick leave usage should be reported to the department timekeeper at the end of the month in which it is taken. 2011 Faculty Handbook - Chapter 8 - Salary, Leave, and Economic Benefits - The University of 4:13:40 PM]Full-time faculty accrue 67.5 hours (9 days) of sick leave for full-time employment for a full academic year and up to 22.5 hours (3 days) of sick leave for full-time employment throughout summer sessions. The calculation below shows how a full- time faculty member would accrue sick leave hours for a period of employment during the summer. See Example:a. Base pay for the previous Academic Year $50,000 b. Maximum summer earning equals 25% of Line (a) 12,500 c. Actual earning for the current summer 9,850 d. Maximum hours that may be accrued for summer sick leave 22.5 hours Calculation: Line (c) divided by Line (b) = 78.8% X Line (d) = 17.7 hours summer sick leave accrual. NOTE: Twenty-five percent (25%) of base academic-year pay is considered to be full-time for summer. Sick Leave Bank The Faculty Sick Leave Bank is available to faculty who elect to become members. It allows each faculty member the opportunity to draw upon it should their own leave balance be exhausted. Sick bank time applies to a faculty member's own serious illness. Membership is obtained by donating three days of sick leave (22.5 hours) into the bank. These days are completely forfeited and cannot be returned during the faculty member's service or at retirement. A committee appointed by the president establishes policies and procedures for the bank under the regulations of the Tennessee Board of Regents. For additional information, contact the Department of Human Resources. See also University policy #1609 ( Family Medical Leave Faculty are eligible for up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave during a twelve month period for specified family and medical reasons provided they have worked for the State of Tennessee for at least twelve months and at least 1,250 hours during the preceding year. Family and medical leave (FMLA) may be requested for the birth or adoption of a child, or for the serious illness of self, spouse, child, or parent. Available sick leave will be paid monthly, to the extent the faculty member's leave balance is sufficient, and this paid leave will be charged during the period of FMLA absence. If the faculty member's sick leave balance is inadequate to extend through a maximum of twelve weeks FMLA, the remaining FMLA leave will be unpaid if that additional time off is necessary.

Retirement Plans Upon employment, all regular full-time employees are enrolled in a retirement system. The only exception is that non-U.S. citizens who are on an F-1 or J-1 visa are not eligible. The retirement contributions are paid in full by the University. Faculty members have a choice of joining either the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System (TCRS) or an Optional Retirement Program (ORP). The TCRS is a defined benefit plan and requires five years of service for a member to be vested (have ownership). Retirement benefits are based on the number of years of service, age, and salary. An ORP is a defined contribution plan with retirement benefits based on the contribu tions that go into the plan and the interest earned on that money. Vesting in the ORP is immediate. Information packets regarding the retirement plans are available in the Department of Human Resources. Tax-Deferred Annuities The University of Memphis offers two long-term savings plans designed to supplement income after retirement. 403(b) - a tax-deferred annuity plan designed for educational nonprofit institutions401(k) - a deferred compensation plan Employees may contribute a specified amount to the plans through salary deduction. Amounts contributed do not affect other retirement plans. Contributions and earning of the plans are not subject to federal income tax until funds are withdrawn. Generally, withdrawals are not permitted before age 59+ or retirement. Amounts contributed and early withdrawals are subject to IRS regulations and will be subject to a federal penalty.
