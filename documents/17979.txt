Any hours other than holiday hours and work hours are excluded from overtime compensation. (For example, sick and annual leave hours are excluded from overtime compensation.) There are two categories of overtime as follows: A. Straight Overtime After an employee has accrued for overtime pay purposes 37.5 hours during any work week, additional work or holiday hours up to 40 hours during the same week will be compensated at straight-time (regular rate of pay). B. Premium Overtime When an employee has accrued for overtime pay purposes 40 hours during any work week, additional work or holiday hours during the same week will be compensated at premium time (one and one-half times the regular rate of pay).
