The only downside is your laptop won’t last all day once you unplug it. Here are a few ways to help your battery go the distance. Is your battery fully charged? Before you take your laptop with you on the go, make sure the battery is fully charged. Laptops can take several hours to charge, so let your laptop charge overnight. Use battery saver mode. Your laptop comes with built-in power management settings. These settings will help to optimize battery life by reducing power consumption. Turn off anything you aren’t using. External devices and features such as Bluetooth drain your battery. You can extend your battery life by unplugging or disabling anything you aren’t using; this includes Wi-Fi. Don’t multitask. Running several programs at once requires more processing powers which drains more power. Working on one task at a time will help your battery last longer. You can also try using software that use less features. For example you can type in a simple text file instead of a Word Document. Other Options Defrag your hard drive so your system operates more efficiently. Upgrade to a solid-state drive which saves energy by using flash memory instead of moving parts. Buy an extra battery to take with you on the go. Posted in Facutly Resources , Student Resources Subscribe by Email Completely spam free, opt out any time.
