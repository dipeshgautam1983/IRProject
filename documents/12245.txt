Humphreys School of Law, has been selected to participate in the 2015 Tennessee Board of Regents' Maxine Smith Fellows Program. TBR is the governing body for 46 universities, community colleges and technology centers throughout the state. The Maxine Smith Fellows program provides diverse employees of TBR schools the opportunity to participate in a working and learning environment that will enhance their career experience and development. It is intended to provide an introduction to administrative roles in system or upper-level administrative policy-making positions. Each Fellow is assigned an administrative mentor at the TBR central office, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission or one of the TBR schools. The Fellow works with a mentor to develop a Fellowship work plan. Allen's mentor will be Dr. Tristan Denley, TBR vice chancellor for Academic Affairs. "I am grateful for the opportunity and consider it a great honor to be chosen to represent the University of Memphis as a Maxine Smith Fellow," said Allen. "Dr. Maxine Smith was a central figure in the history of Memphis' civil rights struggle, particularly with respect to education. The fellowship is opportunity to continue the progress towards realizing her dreams." Allen earned her juris doctorate from the Yale Law School. Her teaching interests are in the areas of torts and health law policy. She was elected Professor of the Year in 2013. Allen's current research agenda includes issues related to legislative attempts to improve care for women with breast cancer.
