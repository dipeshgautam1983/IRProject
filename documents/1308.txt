The faculty are committed to teaching, inspiring, and mentoring students who will meet the following objectives: (1) graduates will meet the expectations of employers of civil engineers; (2) qualified graduates will pursue advanced study if that is consistent with their career plans; and (3) graduates will assume/undertake leadership roles in their communities and/or professions. Civil engineering graduates will engage in a broad range of self-development activities that benefit the civil engineering profession and the community. The civil engineering program is greatly enhanced by a diverse student body spanning a wide range of ages, backgrounds, and nationalities. The Civil Engineering program of study provides an integrated educational experience that combines study in basic and engineering science, the humanities, and the social sciences with practical experience in laboratory experimentation, problem solving, and engineering design. Students may pursue a general course of study or may elect to specialize in water resources or one of the following concentrations: environmental, structural, geotechnical, transportation, or construction engineering. ADMISSION: Admission to the university will allow a student to be in a pre-civil engineering major. Movement into the major requires completion of the courses listed below with a minimum grade of "C" in each of these courses. MATH 1910, CHEM 1110, CIVL 1101, CIVL 1112, and ENGL 1010 Monitoring of a student's progress will be performed by the Herff College of Engineering academic advisor. A student will not be forwarded to the academic department for advising until these courses have been satisfactorily completed. Pre-civil engineering majors may not register for CIVL courses at or above the 3000-level. Exceptions to these criteria are at the discretion of the department chair. GRADUATION: To qualify for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, a student must satisfy general university and college requirements, have a minimum grade of "C" in all engineering, science, and mathematics courses that are applied toward the degree, and complete the course sequence outlined below. For credits transferred from another institution, only those civil engineering, science, and mathematics courses with a minimum grade of "C" may be applied toward the degree. Waiver of departmental graduation requirements for exceptional circumstances will be granted only upon approval of both the department chair and the Dean of the College of Engineering (or designee). HONORS PROGRAM: Students are eligible for the honors program in Civil Engineering if they have an minimum overall GPA of 3.25 with a junior or senior standing or have received approval of the departmental honors committee. The honors program in civil engineering requires 12 hours of upper division honors courses. Those students who complete the program and the regular B.S.C.E. requirements will be recognized at the commencement ceremony by having their degree conferred “With Honors in Civil Engineering.” Moreover, the student’s diploma and record at the University of Memphis will reflect this accomplishment. Details concerning this program and honors course offerings are available in the Department of Civil Engineering. Accelerated B.S.C.E./M.S. Program in Civil Engineering This program allows outstanding undergraduates to earn a bachelor's degree and master's degree in Civil Engineering in as little as five years by taking graduate-level technical electives that will count toward both degree programs. Specifically, students who are selected into this program can satisfy the undergraduate requirement of nine hours of technical electives by taking 6000-level courses that will then be counted toward their graduate degree program. However, the graduate coursework will not apply to the undergraduate GPA. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.S.C.E/M.S. program early in their undergraduate career in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Civil Engineering. Students with a minimum GPA of 3.25 may apply for the accelerated program once they have completed 15 credit hours of 3000-level CIVL course work. In addition to an application form, students must have the recommendation of their undergraduate academic advisor, and the concurrence of the department chair and graduate coordinator in the Department of Civil Engineering. In order to remain in the program, students must maintain a GPA of at least 3.25. To continue in the program past the B.S.C.E. degree, students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and the Civil Engineering M.S. program. Civil Engineering Major (B.S.C.E.) A.
