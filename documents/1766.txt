Whereas financial accounting provides essential information to outsiders for the purpose of judging a company’s performance, managerial accounting provides essential information to those people that r un organizations. In contrast to financial accounting information, management accounting information is: • designed and intended for use by managers within the organization, whereas financial accounting information is designed for use by shareholders and cre ditors; • usually confidential and used by management, instead of publicly reported; • forward -looking, instead of historical; !• computed by reference to the needs of managers, often using management information systems , instead of by reference to financial accounting standards .!F%' 1G'H$:&:7'&I"# 1G'H$:&:7'&E !ACCT 2010 – Fundamentals of Accounting I G'H$:%'5!.'J7&!K+45!

It involves analyzing business transactions, knowing how to record those transactions, preparing financial statements, and interpreting financial resu lts. Though Managerial Accounting involves less analyzing and more interpreting, it is still true that homework, class work and attendance are the keys to success. Students often falsely believe that they can wait until the night before the exam, cram ever ything in, and do just as well as if they were prepared daily. To do well, you need to attend class each period. I can help to synthesize the material and point out the key concepts that are needed. Students generally learn far more in less time inside of class than they do on their own outside of class. Students should also complete as much of the assigned homework as possible before class. At the very least, read the chapter! There are more problems in managerial accounting then there are in financial accounting. Students not familiar with the problems will have difficulty keeping up in class. Finally, expect that you can learn the material each class. Do !"# &##not be intimidated by the numbers or the complexity of the topic. Your goal should be to understan d all material each class. This course focuses on the core competencies of managerial accounting that are vital to success in management positions as well as information needed for accounting majors to succeed in upper level accounting courses. This is no t to say that the information not covered in the textbook is not useful. You may find this is a good reference book for future career decisions you may face. Beginning with the second chapter, select learning objectives will be covered. Be sure to read the course schedule below to know what material will be covered and tested. Some students have a natural talent for understanding accounting and do well on the multiple -choice exams with relatively little effort. Other students are able to master the material only after working very hard. Finally, for some students, the analytical thinking process associated with accounting is a skill that they seem to have been born without and regardless of the time and effort put into the course it just doesn’t come. If this is you and you have honestly put forth your best effort, do not get discouraged. This is just one course in your college career and this probably just means that you will end up hiring an accountant rather than doing it yourself. Do the best you can, learn as much as you can, and do not become overly concerned about your ultimate grade.

The first exam covers chapters 1 -4, the second exam covers chapters 5 -7, and the third exam covers 8, 10, and 11. The final exam is comprehensive . Exams must be taken at the scheduled time . No late exams will be given except for official u niversity -approved activities. If a student misses an exam for personal reasons (sickness, family emergency, etc.), then it will be considered the lowest exam grade and dropped. The final exam is scheduled for December 4th from 3:30 – 5:30pm! It cannot be dropped! All sections of ACCT 202 0 take the exam together. Be certain you make the final exam! Because of advances in technology, we are also requiring that you use ONLY a basic five -function calculator for exams. You should not have to spend more than $5.00, and some models start at $1.00. If it costs more than $5.00, it is probably unacceptable. Additionally, because of advances in cell phone technology, cell phones have become a powerful text storage and transmittal format. For this reason, cell phones must be turned off and put away during exams and exam review (as they should be all other Lowest grade will be dropped.

If you have any questions and/or concerns about the calculator you are using, see the instructor before the exam so that we can resolve the issue. Academic misconduct during an exam will result in a grade of zero for that exam and notification to University officials. Academic misconduct includes helping or getting help from others or using unauthorized materials in completing the exam. Academic misconduct is considered unethical behavior and students should not compromise their integrity for s omething as trivial as a grade in this course. X$:YY'& !Quizzes are attached to each of the chapters in Connect . These quizzes are worth 3 points each and close on the last date the chapter is covered (see schedule below) . You may attempt the quizzes twice and the highest grade will count. Missed quiz questions are shown after you submit your quiz for grading. The quiz questions are very similar to the questions that you will see on the exams, and the importance of pract icing these questions cannot be emphasized enough. The quizzes have stated end dates and will not be available after the end date.

The cutoff date will be before each exam on the new chapters: Ch. 1 – 4, September 26th; Ch. 5 – 7, October 26th, Ch. 8, 10 – 11, November 2 8th. The highest grade is recorded.

Each period will begin with a lecture of the day’s topic, followed by working select end -of-chapter material. Most classes will include class work entitled GUDS (Greater Understanding Device S) that will be worked !"# )##in class and handed in for 2 points. These will always be open book and open notes. The GUDS will be checked to make sure you attempted to solve the problem; h owever, the material will not be graded. You will receive the 2 points as long as you make a serious attempt and are present to turn in the class work. The GUDS will be reviewed at the beginning of the next class. If you are not present, you cannot make up the GUDS unless you are on a school -sanctioned trip. To allow for those “unexpected” absences, 10 extra points are included in the total possible points. If you hand in all the GUDS, complete all the Connect assignments correctly and answer all the q uizzes correctly, the extra points will be treated like bonus points as long as you make at least a 65 average on your exams . Technology Rules: Computers will not be allowed in class . In the past, computers have been allowed. However, the temptation to give in to distractions like internet and email has proven too great. If you use the eBook, you will need to print the pages or slides prior to class. The printed slides are the best means for taking notes! Cell phones will not be allowed in class . Should I see you using a cell phone (texting, talking, playing with it…), you will lose the GUDS for that day and your cell phone will be confiscated until the end of class! Students will LOSE the GUDS points for the day if they disrupt the class in any way, such as talking excessively, using cellphones, or other similar distracting behavior. It is my responsibility to other students and to the University to create an environment conducive to learning. Your disruption of that environment will result in a loss of points and could lead to expulsion from the course. -55:4;!I!Q%#TT:4;E !If you have questions about adding or dropping classes, please refer to this page on the Registrar’s website . -9+5'6:9!<47';%:7)E! !The University of Memphis has clear codes regarding cheating and classroom misconduct.
