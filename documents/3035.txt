Accelerated BS/MS Degree Program, with concentrations in Applied Mathematics, Mathematics, and Statistics This program allows outstanding undergraduates to complete both a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Sciences and a Master of Science degree in Mathematical Sciences with concentration in Applied Mathematics, Mathematics or Statistics. Students admitted into the program will follow a carefully designed program of study which allows them to begin course work for the Master of Science program during their senior year. Interested students are encouraged to consult with their undergraduate advisor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and to begin planning to enter the accelerated BS/MS degree program early in their undergraduate career. Through careful coordination with their undergraduate and graduate advisors students will be able to graduate with both a bachelor's and master's degree within a five year period. To apply, students must have finished 18 credit hours of course work in mathematics by the end of the semester of their application. Applicants must have a cumulative GPA of 3.00 (on a 4.0 scale) as well as a GPA of 3.30 (on a 4.0 scale) in their mathematics courses. The initial application for the accelerated BS/MS degree program consists of the following two parts: 1. A letter of intent including two letters of reference and a copy of the applicant's transcript to be submitted to the Department of Mathematical Sciences 2. Application with the Graduate School for "combination senior" status To continue in the program beyond the bachelor's degree, students must also apply for full admission into the Graduate School and be accepted into the master's program by the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. Details on courses that can be applied will be available in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. However, any graduate course work will not be used to calculate the undergraduate GPA. D. Electives Electives may be chosen to bring the total number of hours to 120. E. Honors Program The Department of Mathematical Sciences offers an honors program in Mathematics and Statistics for the talented student. To be admitted into the program, an entering freshman must score at least 29 on the Math ACT, and have a high-school GPA of 3.50, although exceptions may be made by the freshman's advisor, based upon an interview at the time of initial registration. Currently enrolled students may be admitted into the Honors Program upon an interview with the Departmental Honors Director. The basic requirements will be a 3.5 GPA on all MATH courses, an overall GPA of 3.25, and timely progress toward a degree. Such students may be admitted into MATH 1421, 2421, or 2422. Upon completion of the entry course with a grade of at least B, such students will retroactively receive credit for any previous course(s) in the Honors Sequence. A student may not enroll in MATH 3402 without having previously completed MATH 2422. The successful candidate will complete the Major Core as listed about under item C, and complete one of the Areas of Concentration listed about, with the following exceptions and additions: In place of MATH 1910, 1920, 2110, and 3242, the Honors student must complete the four-course sequence of Honors Mathematics courses (MATH 1421, 2421, 2422, and 3402), and two semesters of the Mathematics Honors Seminar, MATH 3410 and 3411. Upon successful completion of the courses listed above, the student shall be considered to have completed MATH 3242, and MATH 3120 for prerequisite and graduation purposes. The Honors student must take MATH 4402 - Senior Honors Seminar. Each of MATH 1421, 2421, 2422, 3402, 3410, 3411, 4402 must be completed with at least a grade of B. A GPA of 3.50 in all MATH courses must be maintained. Upon completion of the program, the successful candidates will be recognized at the commencement ceremony by having their degrees conferred "With Honors in Mathematical Sciences," and their diplomas and records at the University of Memphis will reflect this distinction.
