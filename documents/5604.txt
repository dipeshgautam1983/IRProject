Department of Theatre &amp; Dance About Academic Programs Admissions People Production Archives Home Theatre &amp; Dance Archives The Wedding Singer The Wedding Singer Music by Matthew Sklar Lyrics by Chad Beguelin; Book by Beguelin and Tim Herlihy. November 6-8 and 13-15, 2014 — Mainstage PHOTOS Journey back to 1985: Wham! had the #1 song...Back to the Future was the #1 movie...Gas cost $1 per gallon...Yuppies dominated popular culture...and Ron and Nancy handed out jelly beans. Based on the hit movie starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, The Wedding Singer pays loving homage to the pop songs of the 1980s. Nominated for five Tony Awards, this hip musical comedy offers three weddings, a bar mitzvah and a 50th wedding anniversary, keeping things hopping in this affectionate look back to the days when hair was big, greed was good, collars were up, and a wedding singer just might be the coolest guy in the room!
