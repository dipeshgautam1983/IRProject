The ATEAM is co-directed by Dr. Christian Mueller, Dr. Denise Winsor, and Dr. Chia-chen Yang in the Educational Psychology program at the University of Memphis. Our Goals to research topics of interest including; peer influences, context, motivation, social media, epistemological beliefs, self-concept, and other topics related to academic performance. to have graduate students become active participants in all facets of conducting research and cultivate an environment which supports and facilitates learning from multiple perspectives in theory and research. to provide support and critical feedback in the research process from investigating current literature, design and analysis of data, preparing conference proposals, and submitting scientific articles for publication. to foster students as independent researchers who are competent and efficacious about pursuing their own research interests. Our Current Projects Ecological influences on identity, motivation, engagement, and academic achievement in College Students Utilizing an ecological approach, we are exploring the impact of perceived social support (e.g., significant other, friends, professors) on college student motivation, identity exploration, engagement and achievement. Implications of this study are twofold: 1) to understand how social support impacts the psychosocial and academic functioning of college students, and 2) to understand how this relationship impacts college student engagement and achievement. Multiple social media project Our current project focuses on university students' use of multiple new media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and its association with the users' socio-emotional well-being. Findings will shed light on whether and how the use of different social media platforms is related to the outcomes differently. By studying more than one platform and the various activities afforded by these platforms, we aim to unravel the diverse roles social media can play in young people's lives.
