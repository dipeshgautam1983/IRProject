ABSTRACT: Modern integrated development environments come with a host of tools to make your development experience both more efficient and less frustrating. In this talk I will introduce both basic and advanced features that are common throughout most of the mainstream IDE's. Tools include code generation, refactoring, quick fix context menus, debugging, and profiling to name a few.
