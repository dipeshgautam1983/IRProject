While this information is still available via Employee Self Service, employees now have easier access to this information as pay stubs are now e-mailed directly to their University e-mail accounts upon processing. When you receive an e-mail from the payroll office with a copy of your pay stub in attachment, it can be opened by double-clicking the file. Your computer must have Adobe Acrobat Reader software installed. This software is standard on most University computers; contact your Local Technical Support Provider if you need help. PASSWORD INFORMATION Your pay stub is password-protected. Your password is your last name in lowercase letters AND the last four digits of your social security number. For example, if your name is John Doe and your social security number is 123-45-6789 , your password would be doe6789 . If you have trouble accessing your e-mail pay stub or need it re-sent, contact the ITD Helpdesk at (901) 678-8888.
