L. Bennett summarized the changes proposed by the College of Arts and Sciences. There was a good deal of discussion pertaining to proposals from the Departments of Computer Science, Earth Sciences, and Political Science. AS 2 (II.C.1.a.i.): Is it possible to take all 4 core requirements in the first semester? Three (9 hours) must be taken before 18 hours taken in program. AS 3: Is the minimum undergraduate GPA 2.5 or 2.7? Not all of the business courses are appropriate or are currently being taught. AS 4 (IV.B.2): Are the additional requirements before or after making up master™s courses. Unclear what are post-master™s requirements. AS 9 (II.A.2): Wording ambiguous; will be rewritten to clarify that creating a publication quality paper refers to GEOG 7900, not the thesis. AS 12 (Graduate Certificate in African American Literature): Enrollment projections will be revised. AS 13A (PORT 6024, Portuguese for Spanish Majors: Introduction to Brazilian Short Stories): course title should be the title, not the subtitle as shown in the Curricular Log. AS 27 (POLS 7102, Political Statistics) was tabled. There are at least 7 other stat courses being offered in different departments. This one is very similar to the one in the Communication Department. Dr. Weddle-West asked D. Wark, E. Rakow, S. Slack, and representatives from other departments with stat courses (such as Larry Peterson from Sociology, Pradeep Sopory from Communication, Political Science, Psychology, Fogelman College of Business and Economics, and Loewenberg School of Nursing) to form a task-force to clarify the issue of duplication and whether there is a real need for individual stat courses. It was suggested that if datasets are the only difference, separate sections can be made up for one course. Curricular revisions from the College of Arts and Sciences, with resolution of the above-mentioned issues, were approved by voice vote. 2 Meeting 368, 12/1/06 368.4.2.2 C.
