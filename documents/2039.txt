The program is designed to provide students satisfying, robust, and quality education in Computer Engineering, leading to professional employment and/or graduate level education. The program educational objectives are that within a few years, graduates will have secured employment in Electrical or Computer Engineering or related fields; advanced their careers as measured by promotions, salaries, career satisfaction, positions of leadership, awards, recognitions, entrepreneurial activities, development of products or process, patents, and/or publications; continued to learn new knowledge and to acquire new expertise as measured by post-graduate education, continuing education, and/or professional registration; contributed to society and the profession as measured by professional service, community service, and/or public service.. In pursuit of these objectives, students enrolled in Electrical Engineering are offered a curriculum designed to provide a thorough background and understanding of the theoretical and physical principles of electric and magnetic phenomena. The intent of the program is to produce graduates who can apply concepts and techniques of mathematics and physics to a variety of analysis and design applications in Electrical Engineering. In addition graduates are prepared to communicate their ideas succinctly and clearly in both oral and written presentations. Graduates of Electrical Engineering will have demonstrated: a. an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering b. an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data c. an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability d. an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams e. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems f. an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility g. an ability to communicate effectively h. the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context i. a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning j. a knowledge of contemporary issues k. an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice. Laboratory facilities are available for a wide variety of instructional and research activities. Significant laboratory activity is required in the curriculum. Career opportunities include positions in development and design, research, sales, management, manufacturing, and construction. Some of the technical areas of opportunity are related to computer applications, communications systems, power generation and distribution systems, microwave and antenna systems, automatic control systems, and general instrumentation. An undergraduate student, with the approval of the department chairman, may select some electives that satisfy the course entrance requirements for medical school. Honors Program: Students are eligible for the honors program in Electrical Engineering if they have and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.4 with at least junior standing and have received approval of the departmental honors committee. The honors program in Electrical Engineering requires a minimum of 8 hours of honors courses in Electrical Engineering and must include the completion of an honors thesis (EECE 4999). Those students who complete the program and the regular B.S.E.E. requirements will be recognized at the commencement ceremony by having their degree conferred "With Honors in Electrical Engineering." Moreover, the student's diploma and record at the University of Memphis will reflect this accomplishment. Details concerning this program and honors course offerings are available in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers a Master of Science degree for electrical engineers who desire advanced study. The department also offers a concentration in Electrical Engineering for students pursuing the interdepartmental Doctor of Philosophy degree. Details about the program and the program objectives are available on the departmental home page ( ). ADMISSION: Admission to the university will allow a student to be in a pre-electrical engineering major. Movement into the major requires completion of the courses listed below with a minimum grade of "C" in each of these courses. MATH 1910, CHEM 1110, PHYS 2110, EECE 1202, COMP 1900, and ENGL 1010 Monitoring of a student's progress will be performed by the Herff College of Engineering academic advisor. A student will not be forwarded to the academic department for advising until these courses have be satisfactorily completed. Pre-electrical engineering majors may not register for EECE courses at or above the 3000-level. Exceptions to these criteria are at the discretion of the department chair. GRADUATION: The minimum requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering are given below. The student must satisfy general university and college requirements. The student must obtain a minimum grade of "C-" in EECE courses and in MATH 1910, 1920, 2110, 3120; CHEM 1110/1111; PHYS 2110/2111, 2120/2121; COMP 1900, or any equivalents to these courses used to satisfy degree requirements. No transfer credit with a grade less than "C-" may be used to satisfy a requirement for the Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. Waiver of departmental graduation requirements for exceptional circumstances will be granted only upon approval of both the department chair and the Dean of the College of Engineering (ordesignee). MINORS: Students satisfying the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering may also satisfy requirements for a minor offered by a department in one of the other colleges. Requirements for minors are specified by the appropriate college and department. Students should submit application for the minor to the appropriate department chair. Candidates for graduation who satisfy requirements for a minor should file the approved application with the intent-to-graduate cards. Accelerated B.S.E.E./M.S. Program in Electrical Engineering This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Science in Electrical Engineering during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.S.E.E./M.S. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study that will allow them to complete their B.S.E.E. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.S. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in electrical engineering. Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.S.E.E./M.S. program, which allows them to take graduate courses in electrical engineering. To continue in the program past the B.S.E.E., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the Electrical and Computer Engineering department's M.S. program. Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply to undergraduate GPA.
