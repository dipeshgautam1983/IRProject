Thanks for posting. ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Toni Bargagliotti Tue, 10 Feb 2015 23:48:39 +0000 Betsy was the best librarian I&#8217;ve ever known. She was always helpful to nursing faculty and students. She offered so many workshops for nursing faculty over the years. She was so patient with everyone because she loved helping anyone. She was always willing to be embedded in my RODP graduate courses and was a wonderful resource for students. I loved working with her and always appreciated her warm smile, patience, and willingness to help everyone. She will be so missed. I cannot imagine the library without Betsy. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and her colleagues. ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Maurice Crouse Mon, 09 Feb 2015 19:37:41 +0000 I first met Betsy when the library of Memphis State University was located in the &#8220;new&#8221; part of the building (now the Wilder Tower at The University of Memphis). She and Sharon Mader were being advertised as the new IRS people. My initial reaction was &#8220;My goodness, what are income tax people doing in a university library?&#8221; It turned out that they were &#8220;information retrieval specialists,&#8221; librarians specially trained to ferret out information from computers (this was before there was even an Internet). When I inherited a graduate-level class, Introduction to Historical Research and Writing, Betsy was one of the members of the library staff to whom I turned to provide instruction in how to use computers for historical research. Over the years, she tirelessly lectured, demonstrated, and provided handouts for my class. Moreover, she and her Reference Room staff patiently endured the yearly onslaught of my students who during the examination period descended upon the library to search out answers to my arcane questions about history. For the entire week of exams they were asked to refrain from doing what comes naturally to librarians&#8211;leading students directly to the information that was being sought. Instead, the only assistance they could give was to tell students where a book or resource was physically located within the library and only if the students asked about a definite title. Betsy was a first-class librarian. To describe her, Chaucer&#8217;s description of the Oxford Clerk, the ideal scholar, would have to be amended to read: &#8220;Gladly would she learn, and gladly teach.&#8221; That was Betsy Park. ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Scott Cohen Mon, 02 Feb 2015 20:32:49 +0000 Betsy Park was a colleague of mine since 1972. I often talked with her and got wonderful advice about reference services, library instruction and other matters. She spoke her mind and spoke the truth. She was a true professional whom I admired. I will miss her greatly. ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Yolanda Hawkins Mon, 02 Feb 2015 14:53:28 +0000 Betsy&#8217;s granddaughter was born around the same time I had my daughter. We often talked about how our babies were growing and developing, their first words and first steps. We would share stories and beautiful pictures of our babies with each other. Whenever we would see each other, Betsy would say, &#8220;How&#8217;s your daughter?&#8221;, and I would say, &#8220;She&#8217;s doing great! How&#8217;s your granddaughter?&#8221; From that point on, we would spend the rest of our time talking about our girls! Sharing stories and pictures of our babies made us smile, laugh and bond with each other! I&#8217;ll forever cherish that time I spent with Betsy! ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Loel Kim Mon, 02 Feb 2015 05:14:39 +0000 I just discovered of Betsy&#8217; passing and am deeply saddened by her loss for her family and friends and for the University of Memphis community. Over the years, she has been a great support in developing library resources for specific classes, lately for online courses. From my all too few interactions with her, she was generous, smart, and a person could just tell&#8211;she was that rare good person. Now that I read of her many other interests and travels, I am REALLY sorry I didn&#8217;t get to know her better! My sympathies to her family and close friends. &#8211;Loel ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Tamme Haskell Sun, 01 Feb 2015 15:18:38 +0000 As one of Betsy&#8217;s younger siblings I&#8217;d like to share a few thoughts. From an early age, Betsy was always reading books. Wherever she went, she carried a book. During high school Betsy would, more often than not, study until 1-2 AM. It certainly was not due to lack of understanding. She was extremely thorough and curious. I&#8217;d often ask her to help me with my homework assignments and her response was consistently the same, &#8220;Look it up&#8221;. (Our father was not as WISE!). In Kansas City, MO, Betsy was Valedictorian of her high school class; she was known to many as a &#8220;Latin scholar&#8221; (which pleased our father immensely); she was team captain in field hockey and basketball; she was a whizz at tennis and Ping-Pong; during summers in Santa Fe, NM she accumulated more blue ribbons competing in gymkhanas (horseback riding) than the combined total of her other 4 siblings. You know, other than hair pulling fights with Ingrid (18 mo. younger), Elizabeth Cummings Haskell Park was just a WONDERFUL PERSON and anyone who knew her would realize just how lucky they were. With tremendous sadness, Tamme Haskell ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Rachel Ennis Sun, 01 Feb 2015 02:51:11 +0000 So sorry that Betsy lost this battle.. I loved our dinner club!.. Betsy was an amazing hostess and chef.. I was so impressed.. and shocked to see her weekly dinner menus that she had planned&#8230; literally going back 30 years!! She and her beautiful smile.. will be missed. ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Rachel Scott Fri, 30 Jan 2015 18:48:59 +0000 Betsy was recommended as a faculty mentor when I started at the University of Memphis. Without her encouragement, I wouldn&#8217;t have had the nerve to submit my first peer-reviewed article. Her matter-of-fact demeanor belayed a strong enthusiasm and support of her colleagues and their endeavors. She believed that librarians should be scholars and, as her record of scholarship shows, she led by example. She also helped me transition back to work after maternity leave; she was an excellent sounding board for working moms. I&#8217;ll remember Betsy as a determined, loyal, and wise mentor. ]]> Comment on A Tribute to Our Colleague and Friend Betsy Park by Stacey Smith Thu, 29 Jan 2015 22:31:58 +0000 I toured UTK&#8217;s library with Betsy and other U of M library staff a couple of years ago. I talked about the challenges I was having with the Distance Education MLIS program and she began to tell me about the advantages. She had a hearty laugh and I will never forget her encouragement. I wish I could tell her that I graduated&#8230; ]]>
