FedEx Center for Supply Chain Management: Home Welcome The FedEx Center for Supply Chain Management was established in 1993 as a strategic alliance between FedEx and The University of Memphis (originally titled the FedEx Center for Cycle Time Research). Part of the FedEx Institute of Technology, the FedEx Center is a leader in applied supply chain management research. The FedEx Center for Supply Chain Management was the recipient of the 2003 Academic Excellence Award by the Tennessee State Board of Regents in recognition of its accomplishments. Over the past decade, few topics have received more attention in the business world than supply chain management (SCM). Integrated supply chain management is now recognized as a core competitive strategy. As organizations continuously seek to provide their products and services to customers faster, better and cheaper than the competition, managers have come to realize that they cannot do it alone. Organizations are now taking a broad "systems" view of the entire supply chain required to design, produce, and deliver their products and services. Businesses are working more closely with both their suppliers and customers to meet the needs of the ultimate consumer. This represents a major change for many organizations. By creating information visibility through the innovative use of information technology, developing collaboration and trust among supply chain member organizations, and integrating and improving supply chain process performance, organizations can transform their supply chains into high-performing value systems. These value systems provide a real competitive advantage in the marketplace. The FedEx Center for Supply Chain Management is helping organizations locally, nationally, and internationally meet their key supply chain management challenges. Recent News about the FECSCM
