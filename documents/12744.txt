A digital footprint is the trail of data that all of your online activities create. There are two types or digital footprints, passive and active.  A passive footprint is the data that is left behind unintentionally and sometimes collected without your knowledge. An example of this is your IP address and in some cases your search history. An active footprint is the data you intentionally share online such as social media posts. Your active footprint is easier to manage than your passive digital footprint. Why does it matter? Your digital footprint can be easily searched and shared. Because this information can be both permanent and public it is important to be mindful of what you leave behind.
