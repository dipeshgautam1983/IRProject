This discussion has been prepared by management along with the financial statements and related note disclosures and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes. The financial statements, notes, and this discussion are the responsibility of management. Using This Annual Report This report consists of three basic financial statements. The Statement of Net Assets; the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets; and the Statement of Cash Flows provide information on the University of Memphis as a whole and present a long- term view of the finances. The Statement of Net Assets The Statement of Net Assets presents the financial position of the University at the end of the fiscal year and includes all assets and liabilities of the University. The difference between total assets and total liabilities net assets is an indicator of the current financial condition of the University. Assets and liabilities are generally measured using current values. One notable exception is capital assets, which are stated at historical cost less an allowance for depreciation. Net assets are divided into three major categories. The first category, invested in capital assets, net of related debt, provides the equity in property, plant, and equipment owned by the University. The next asset category is restricted net assets, which is divided into two categories, nonexpendable and expendable. The corpus of nonexpendable restricted resources is only available for investment purposes. Expendable restricted net assets are available for expenditure by the University but must be spent for purposes as determined by donors and/or external entities that have placed time or purpose restriction s on the use of the assets. The final category is unrestricted net assets. Unrestricted net assets are available to the institution for any lawful purpose of the institution. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 4 Comparison of FY 201 2 to FY 201 1 On December 16, 2011, the State of Tennessee acquired the assets of Lambuth University for use by the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR). The University of Memphis was given authority to assume control of all assets and to operate the Lambuth Campus as a branch of the University of Memphis. Capital assets, net of related debt increased primarily due to the acquisition of the Lambuth Campus, including $480,423 in land, $27,845,110 in buildings, $643,316 in improvements, $77,000 in equipment and $1,918,348 in library holdings. In FY 2012, the University of Memphis began amortizing TSSBA bond premiums and discounts greater than $100,000 over the life of the bonds. Liabilities increased as a result of a prior period adjustment of $4.2 million in unamortized bond premiums for five projects. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 5 Comparison of FY 201 2 to FY 201 1 Unrestricted net assets decreased principally due to the reclassification of a negative amount from restricted-expendable to unrestricted representing the total amount by which the fair values of certain donor-restricted endowment funds were below the amounts required to be retained permanently in accordance with FAS 117-1. Many of the unrestricted net assets have been designated for specific purposes such as: repairs and replacement of equipment, future debt service, quasi-endowments, capital projects, and student loans. The following graph shows the allocations: Allocation of Net Assets The University 15% 1% 3% 1% 39% 19% 22% 2012 Working Capital Encumbrance Designated Fees Auxiliaries Plant Construction Renewal and Replacement Undesignated 13% 1% 3% 1% 49% 15% 18% 2011 THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 6 Comparison of FY 20 1 2 to FY 20 1 1 Undesignated Net Assets increased primarily due to funds accumulated for handling the transition from the time (FY 2009 - FY 2011) when Federal stimulus and State non - recurring funds were availabl e to supplant the State base reductions to future years when such funds are significantly reduced or totally eliminated from the five - year financial plan implemented in FY 2010 as part of th e State of Tennessee budget process. Renewal and Replacement Net Assets increased as a result of funds accumulated to fund anticipated costs associated with the Enterprise Resource Planning sys tem and Information Technology I nfrastructure. The decrease in Plant Constr uction Net Assets is primarily due to completion of renovation projects previously funded with local and non - recurring S tate funds as well as the utilization of one - time funds to transition to reduced S tate appropriations. The Statement of Re venues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets presents the operating results of the University , as well as the nonoperating revenues and expenses. Annual S tate appropriations, while budgeted fo r operations, are considered non - operating revenues according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America . THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 7 Comparison of FY 2012 to FY 2011 State appropriations for operations (recurring and non-recurring) decreased by $25.6 million or 20% in FY 2012, while capital appropriations increased for various roof replacements. Other nonoperating revenues and expenses decreased due to federally funded State Fiscal Stabilization Funds (SFSF) that were available in FY 2011. No SFSF funds were available in FY 2012. Capital grants and gifts increased primarily due to the acquisition of the Lambuth Campus. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 8 Comparison of FY 2012 to FY 2011 centennial capital campaign. The decrease in investment income is principally due to difficult financial markets. The decrease in other revenues, expenses, gains or losses is due to a lower level of permanently restricted gifts. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 9 Revenues The following is a graphic al illustration of revenues by source (both operating and nonoperating), which are used to fund the operating activities for the years ended June 30, 20 12, and June 30, 201 1 (amounts are presented in thousands of dollars). Comparison of FY 201 2 to FY 201 1 State appropriations for operations decreased by $25.6 million or 20% from FY 2011 due primarily to the elimination of the non-recurring and maintenance of effort funds associated with the Federal Stimulus funding in FY 2010 and FY 2011. Additional decreases were a result of a 2% overall base appropriation reduction and the phased- in r Capital appropriations increased for various roof replacement projects. Gifts increased primarily due to the acquisition of the Lambuth Campus, valued at $30 million. 28% 24% 7% 13% 4.4% 0.5% 0.1% 23% 2012 Tuition and Fees Grants and Contracts Sales and Services Gifts Auxiliary Investment Income Other State Appropriations 25% 26% 7% 8% 5% 0.6% 0.4% 28% 2011 THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 10 Expenses Operating expenses can be displayed in two formats, natural classification and program classification. Both formats are displayed below. Comparison of FY 2012 to FY 2011 Operating costs (utilities, supplies, and other services) increased by $18 million primarily due to the reclassification of library periodicals from capital library holdings to expenses, contractual obligations related to athletic staffing transitions, maintenance and repairs for the Lambuth Campus, and expenses paid by the Foun dation on behalf of the University. Depreciable assets totaling $42.5 million, including $30 million for the Lambuth Campus were capitalized, increasing depreciation expense. In addition, periodicals that were previously capitalized as library holdings were determined to be more appropriately expensed. The estimated useful life of periodicals was decreased from 43% 13% 24% 13% 7% 2012 Salaries and wages Benefits Utilities, supplies, and other services Scholarships and fellowships Depreciation 45% 14% 21% 15% 5% 2011 THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 11 10 to 0 years, resulting in a $21 million reduction in library holdings and an additional depreciation expense of $10.9 million, net of accumulated depreciation. Comparison of FY 201 2 to FY 201 1 Total operating expenses increased principally due to increases for scholarships and fellowships, professional services, departmental enrichment, and special projects, partially offset by a decrease in construction expense. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 12 Comparison of FY 201 2 to FY 201 1 Student Services expenses increased primarily due to contractual obligations related to athletic staffing transitions. Institutional Support expenses increased due to a legal judgment against the University. The decrease in Academic Support and corresponding increase in the other functions is due to the allocation of computer services. This computer allocation credits Academic Support in the salaries, benefits and operating expense categories, and transfers the expense to all the other functions. The increase in depreciation expense is due to a change in accounting estimate for periodicals previously capitalized as library holdings, now determined to be more appropriately expensed. The write off of periodicals resulted in an additional depreciation expense of $10.9 million. Capital Assets and Debt Administration Capital Assets The University of Memphis had $406 million invested in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation of $183.7 million at June 30, 201 2; and $ 384 million invested in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation of $183 .3 million at June 30, 201 1. Depreciation charges totaled $29 million and $18.3 million for the years ended June 30, 201 2, and June 30, 201 1, respectively. Details of these assets are shown below. 30% 9% 2% 6% 13% 8% 8% 13% 4% 7% FY 2012 Instruction Research Public Service Academic Support Student Services Institutional Support Maintenance and Operation of Plant Scholarships and Fellowships Auxiliaries Depreciation 30% 9% 3% 8% 11% 7% 8% 15% 4% 5% FY 2011 THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 13 The University capitalized $30 million in buildings and infrastructure from the acquisition of the Lambuth Campus. Library holdings decreased by $9.4 million due to a change in accounting estimate to expense periodicals beginning in FY 2012 .Planned capital activities for FY 2013 include a new student housing facility (local funds $53 million), a 1,000 car parking garage on Norriswood (local funds $22.1 million), and research facilities improvements (local funds $1.1 million). Plans also include the acquisition of properties for expansion purposes funded through General Obligation Bonds, as well as local funds. financial statements. Debt The University had $107. 6 million and $108.4 million in debt outstanding at June 30, 201 2, and June 30, 20 11, respectively. The table below summarizes these amounts by type of debt instrument. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Management Discussion and Analysis For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 14 The ratings on debt issued by the Tennessee State School Bond Authority at June 30, 201 2, were as follows: Fitch AA+ Aa1 Standard & AA More information about the long-term liabilities is presented in Note 8 to the financial statements. Economic Factors That Will Affect the Future indicate a very slow economic recovery in Tennessee, but the impact this will have on future funding both in operating appropriation and future building projects is not clear. For the fifth consecutive year, base State appropriations will be reduced. The impact of the reduction for FY 2013 is $1.8 million or 2.2% from the previous year. Since FY 2008, the University has sustained a cumulative State appropriation reduction of $43.5 million or 35% by FY 2013. However, the Governor recently completed a listening tour of Tennessee aimed at studying the issues around higher education in Tennessee. The expectation is that higher education will be a prime area of focus during the upcoming legislative session, with an emphasis on the financial burden of higher education on students. To compensate for the reduction in State appropriations, the University will utilize FY 2012 operating carry forward funds to transition to reduced State appropriations in accordance five-year financial plan, which includes b udget reductions, restructuring, position attritions, voluntary buyouts, and tuition increase s. The University has implemented an 8.2% increase in student fees for FY 2013. We remain cognizant of the impact future tuition increases may have on our students and are striving to minimize future increases to the greatest extent possible. The FY 2012 acquisition of the University of Memphis Lambuth Campus and the FY 2013 entrance into the Big East Conference provide a significant opportunity for enrollment and revenue growth. We are not aware of any other factors, decisions, or conditions that are expected to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operation during this fiscal year. Requests for Information for all those with an interest in the finances. Questions concerning any of the information provided in this report or requests for additional financial information should be directed to Libby Shelton, Controller; Administration Building, Room 275 , Memphis, Tennessee 38152.

This system is a component unit of the State of Tennessee because the state appoints a significant financial support; the system is discretely presented in the Tennessee Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. attributable to the transactions of The University of Memphis. The University of Memphis Foundation is considered a component unit of the University . Although the University does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the Foundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, that the Foundation holds and invests are restricted to the activities of the University by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the University, the Foundation is considered a component unit of the University and is discretely presented in the financial statements. See Note 24 for more detailed information about the component unit and how to obtain the report. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The University and F financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to governmental colleges and universities engaged in business-type activities as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). BASIS OF ACCOUNTING For financial statement purposes, the University is considered a special-purpose government engaged only in business-type activities. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met. All significant interfund transactions have been eliminated. Private-sector standards of accounting and financial reporting issued prior to December 1, 1989, generally are followed to the extent that those standards do not conflict with or contradict guidance of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The University has the option of following private-sector guidance issued subsequent to November 30, 1989, subject to the above limitation. The University has elected not to follow private-sector guidance issued subsequent to November 30, 1989. Amounts reported as operating revenues include: 1) tuition and fees, net of waivers and discounts, 2) certain federal, state, local and private grants and contracts, 3) sales and services of auxiliary enterprises, and 4) other sources of revenue.

The funded status of the plan as of July 1, 201 1 , was as follows: Actuarial valuations involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of events far into the future, and actuarially determined amounts are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared to past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of fun ding progress, presented as R equired S upplementary I nformation following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actu arial accrued liability for benefits. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions . Calculations are based on the types of benefits provided under the terms of the substantive plan at the time of each valuation and on the pattern of sharing of costs between the employer and plan members to that point. Actuarial calculations reflect a long - term perspective. Consistent with that perspective, actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce short - term volatility in actuarial ac crued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets. In the July 1, 201 1 , actuarial valuation, the Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 4. 0 percent investment rate of return (net of administrative exp enses) and an annual healthcare cost trend rate of 9 . 2 5 percent in fiscal year 201 2 , decreased to 8.75 percent in fiscal year 201 3 and then reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in fiscal year 2021.

Of this total, $ 864,653. 99 are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at June 30, 20 1 2 . The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used as of June 30, 201 2 . Money Market funds: Valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Limited Partnerships and LLCs: Limited partnerships and LLC investments are generally valued at the et asset value (NAV) of the investee. Some investees invest in equity securities which are valued daily based upon quoted prices in active markets. Certain investees maintain underlying holdings of non - marketable securities whose fair values are estimate d by management of the investee. - The foundation values these investments at estimated fair value based upon its equity in the estimated fair valu e of the investee. These investees are valued at estimated fair value as determined by their management which is based upon the net asset valuations of the underlying investment entities. Fair values for the securities of the underlying investment entiti es are often not readily available and accordingly, the fair values are estimated by management of those entities. Common/collective trust funds: Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of units held by the foundation at year end. Mutual Funds: Valued at quoted market priced which are based upon the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the foundation at year end. U.S. government securities and corporate bonds: Valued at quoted market prices or valuations provided by commercial pricing servi ces or the mean of the bid and ask prices provided by investment brokers. The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although m anagement believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value me asurement at the reporting date. Cash Cash c onsists of demand deposit accounts. The bank balances at June 30, 201 2 , were entirely insured. THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 37 Investments Investments are reco rded on the date of acquisition and are stated at market value. Unrealized gains and losses are determined by the difference between market values at the beginning and end of the year. Investment securities held at year - end were as follows: Alternative Investments - The F oundation has certain limited partnership/LLC investments that are classified for fair value measurement purposes as Level 3 . The estimated fair value of these assets is $ 31,847,251 at June 30, 20 1 2 . The Foundation believes that the carrying amount of such alternative investments is a reasonable estimate of fair value as of June 30, 201 2 . Because these investments are not readily marketable, the estimated value is subject to uncertainty and, therefore, may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and such differences could be material. These investments are made in accordance order to achieve an a ppropriate level of diversification. These investments are designed to enhance diversification and provide reductions in overall portfolio volatility. The fair values are estimated by the and are subject to audit by the Pledges Receivable - Pledges receivable are summarized below net of the allowance for doubtful accounts: Endowments T he University of Memphis wment consists of over 400 individual funds established for a variety of purposes. Its endowment includes both donor - restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by GAAP, net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor - imposed restrictions. Interpretation of Relevant Law The Board of Trustees of the University of Memphis Foundation has interpreted the Uniform Prudent Ma nagement of Institutional Funds Act (the Act) as adopted by Tennessee as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor - restricted e ndowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary . As a result of this interpretation, the Foundation classifies as THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 38 permanently restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original valu e of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, (c) any donor specified accumulations to the permanent endowment funds made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument. The remaining portion of the donor - restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the F oundation in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by t he Act. In accordance with the Act, the F oundation considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor - restricted endowment funds: 1. The duration and preservation of the fund 2. The purposes of the F oundation and the e ndowment fund 3. General economic conditions 4. The possible effect of inflation or deflation 5. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 6. Other resources of the F oundation 7. The investment policies of the F oundation THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended June 30, 20 12 39 Funds with Deficiencies From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individual donor restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the F oundation is required to retain in a fund of perpetual duration. In accordance with U.S. g enerally accepted accounting principles , deficiencies of this nature are reported in unrestricted net assets . These deficiencies resulted from unfavorable market fluctuations that occurred after the investment of permanently restricted contributions and/o r continued appropriation for fees and previously approved budgeted expenditures. At June 30, 201 2 , deficiencies of this nature totaled $ 2,091,263. Return Objectives and Risk Parameters The F oundation has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment as sets include those assets of donor - restricted funds that the organization must hold in perpetuity or for a donor - specified period(s) as well as board - designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are inves ted in a manner that is intended to produce consistent long - term growth of capital without undue market cycle of at least 5% over the inflation rate. A market cycle shall generally be considered to be a three to five year period. Actual returns may vary from the total return objective. Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives To satisfy its long - term rate - of - return objectives, the Foundation reli es on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The Foundation targets a diversified asset allocation that places a significant emphasis on equity - based investments to achieve its long - term return objectives within prudent risk restraints. Spending Policy and How the Investment Objectives Relate The Foundation has a policy of budgeting (appropriating) for expenditure each year a percentage of its - end one year prece d ing the fiscal year in which the expenditure is planned. For fiscal year 201 2 this percentage was four point seven five percent (4.75%). In establishing this policy, the Foundation considered the long - term expected return on its endowment funds. Accordingly, over the long - term, the Foundation expects the current spending policy t to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts and investm ent return.
