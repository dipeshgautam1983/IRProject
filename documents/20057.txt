Leave a comment | Oct 29 2015 Registering for Classes Posted by Christianne Joyce Clorina How&#8217;re you doing, Tigers? Now that you&#8217;ve gone and seen your advisors, it&#8217;s time to register for your courses. It is possible your advisor already registered you for your classes when you had your meeting, but it&#8217;s important to know how to do it yourself just in case you want to change your classes, or add or drop a class. The &#8220;Student&#8221;  tab in your mymemphis portal contains a multitude of useful tools. If you look under this tab, you&#8217;ll see the  &#8220;Registration Tools&#8221;  channel. It is very important that you learn how to use these tools, especially &#8220;Look Up Classes,&#8221; &#8220;Add or Drop Classes,&#8221; and &#8220;Concise Student Schedule.&#8221; How to Look Up Classes: Select the term you are looking to take this class in. Select the subject of this class. Once you select the subject, you can either do a &#8220;course search&#8221; or an &#8220;advanced search.&#8221; If you click on &#8220;course search,&#8221; you will see all of the courses offered under that subject. If you click on &#8220;advanced search,&#8221; you can do a more detailed search. Just fill in the information it is asking for, and find your course! How to Register for a course or Add or Drop Classes: Select the term you are registering for and click submit. To add a class, you will need to choose the add option and find your course. Make sure you double check that you selected the correct course you want, as well as the correct time and days; it has to fit into your schedule! If you add a course that conflicts with another, you will see a &#8220;time conflict with&#8230;&#8221; error. To drop a class, just select that you want to drop a class, and select the class you are dropping. Be sure that you have talked to your advisor and that you are sure you want to drop this class. *** Can&#8217;t see the option to add or drop courses? This may be because it is past the date you are allowed to drop out of a course or add a course.*** Here are some common error messages you may receive:  CLASS RESTRICTION.  You are trying to enroll in a course that is not appropriate for your student classification&#8211;Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior. (For example, if you have Sophomore standing or higher, you cannot enroll in ACAD 1100.) You will not be able to register for this course unless you receive a permit . CLOSED SECTION.  All of the seats allotted for the section have been filled; you will not be able to register for this section unless you receive a permit . CO-REQUISITE ERROR.  You are attempting to add a course that requires one or more co-requisites, that is, another course or courses that must be taken along with the course you have entered. You need to add ALL required courses in one submission. LINK ERROR.  You have added only the lecture or lab section of a course that requires that both the lab and the lecture be taken together in the term. Add both sections in one submission. TIME CONFLICT WITH &#8230;  You are trying to register for two or more courses whose meeting times overlap. Adjust your schedule, or request a permit  for a time conflict. Click here for any other errors you may be receiving. If you cannot find your issue or cannot resolve any other problems, call the ITS Service Desk at 901-678-8888 for further assistance. Have a question? Need help finding a website? Don&#8217;t hesitate to call the ITS Service Desk at 901-678-8888, we&#8217;re here to assist you 24/7.

Come to the Service desk in between the hours of 8 A.M.-7 P.M., located in Administration Building 100. Leave a comment | Oct 22 2015 Are You Getting Ready for Next Semester? Posted by Christianne Joyce Clorina Hey Tigers! A lot of you may be confused by the title of this blog post. Next semester? Finals aren&#8217;t even close yet! You&#8217;re right. However, it is time for you to be picking your courses for the spring semester. For those who are undecided, this may be an intimidating task. Here is an important date: Freshmen registration for the Spring 2016 semester is November 16, 2015. Have you gone to see your advisor yet?  This is something you really should do, especially if you need some guidance regarding your courses. You should have your academic advisor you met with at freshman orientation. If you were undecided and now are considering a specific field of study, there is probably an advisor specifically for your major. Click here for the &#8220;Find My Advisor&#8221; page and scroll to find the advisor for your major! Your advisor is there to help you, but don&#8217;t let them do all of the work! Do some thinking and some planning before you go in for your meeting. The University of Memphis website even provides you with a checklist to make sure you&#8217;re ready. Utilize your resources. The university provides students with a good variety of tools that can assist in choosing courses. Use them! Even if you still end up unsure in what you want to do, you&#8217;ll at least have browsed some possibilities. UMdegree  is available for all students to use. This tool is not only for choosing your next semester courses; it also provides an estimate on how long it will take you to graduate, and so on. When you click on the UMdegree link, located in your mymemphis portal under the &#8220;My Degree&#8221; tab, you will be able to see your requirements, what you have completed, and what you still need to complete. Simply click here for instructions. Courses to Consider  is another tool provided for students. It is also located under the &#8220;My Degree&#8221; tab in your portal (makes sense, right?). This tool lists the courses you could consider taking to finish your area of study. These courses, of course, aren&#8217;t required; they&#8217;re just suggestions. You even have the ability to filter your campus, specific courses, and so on. An important thing to remember: your advisor is there to suggest but YOU choose your courses. If you don&#8217;t think a specific course is right for you, you don&#8217;t have to take it. However, your advisors do know what they are talking about, so don&#8217;t take what they say for granted. Do your research, talk to people. You&#8217;ll never find what you want to do if you don&#8217;t explore your options! Have a question? Need help finding a website? Don&#8217;t hesitate to call the ITS Service Desk at 901-678-8888, we&#8217;re here to assist you 24/7! Leave a comment | Oct 01 2015 Plug In to U of M! Posted by Christianne Joyce Clorina Hey guys!

If you have any questions about Greek Life, the Greek Councils are located in Room 222 in the University Center. Student Organizations are another fun way to get plugged in here at University of Memphis. I know the term &#8220;organization&#8221; sounds a little drab, but I&#8217;m 100% certain we have an organization for you. Organizations at University of Memphis can range from civil rights to art to anime and even to aerial and circus arts. Take a few seconds to browse through our list of organizations , and I&#8217;m sure something will catch your attention. On Campus Jobs are another great way to plug in while earning some money.

A lot of these jobs tend to have flexible schedules; these people know you&#8217;ve got an education to receive! Here is a list of regular student positions  that are in need of workers.

Posted by Christianne Joyce Clorina Hey Tigers! I hope you&#8217;re all having a great semester so far. I wanted to share some helpful resources for getting around campus that would be good to have under your belt. Are you lost?  Most of you probably know where your classes are by now, but there are some days when you may have to go to a certain building for an important meeting, etc. Well, there are a couple of resources you can use to help you. Most of us have smartphones now, so why not use the internet to our advantage? Just visit map.memphis.edu for an easily accessible map on your phone! Did you know the university has an app? While the app has fun things like campus news, events, and even a spirit light, it also has a campus map. This map allows you to pinpoint your own location as well as pinpoint the location you&#8217;re going to. Click here to download the app, or search &#8220;UofMemphis&#8221; in the app store. Don&#8217;t want to walk?  University of Memphis offers a few options for those of you who are tired after a long day of work, or for those who need a faster way to their destinations. Have you tried the Blue Line? There are Blue Line shuttles with different routes that will take you where you need to go. The Blue Line will even take you to the Liberty Bowl for free! No need to worry about finding a parking spot. The Blue Line information site lists all of the different routes and stops, and if you want to track where the buses are, download the Blue Line mobile app ! Rent a bike! This is especially helpful for those who came from far away and don&#8217;t have access to a bike. Bikes are a super efficient way to get places, and for $35 each semester you can rent one. Just go to the Bursar&#8217;s office, located in Wilder Tower, and pay the fee. Then visit 3699 Southern Avenue with your receipt and student ID and get yourself a bike! Have a question?

Posted by Dennis Tyler Stegall Hey Guys, I&#8217;m writing to let you know some things you can do with your campus card you may not know about as well as the website where you can manage funds and gain many other perks. Besides it being your personal ID, your card has many other rolls in your life here at the University of Memphis.  These include holding money, getting in and out of certain building and/or events on campus,  gaining student discounts, and much more. First, learn to carry your campus card with you EVERYWHERE.  Because the university cares about your safety, not just anyone can access areas on campus which you can.  Some of these include the Recreation Center, after hours in the Tech Hub, the Theatre and Dance shows, Dorms, for those who live on campus, etc. Without your ID, you will not be permitted access to areas such as these. On top of that, your campus card is a source of money for any registered students.  There are three types of funds: Tiger Funds, Dining Dollars, and Flex Bucks. Tiger Funds is a debit account accessed through your Campus Card. It can be used at campus dining, most vending locations, the University Bookstore, copiers, university Health Center and the Bursar&#8217;s Office. Dining Dollars . All undergraduate students who are enrolled in 12 or more hours have access to $300 dining dollars, which reset at the beginning of each semester.  Dining dollars can be used for things such as a meal from any dining location on campus or a quick snack from vending machines located throughout campus. Flex Bucks , also known as meal plans, are a ticket to a student&#8217;s meals for the rest of the semester.  If you are a student who depends on the ability to dine on campus, flex bucks are perfect for you.  They&#8217;re set up as a more long-term form of funds, which will provide you a certain amount of meals a day based on your choice of payment. Unfortunately, I know all to well that these funds do sometimes run out; however,  allows students to manage their funds, view transactions, read FAQs, report a lost or stolen card, as well as view maps of dining locations and vending machines.  Using the navigation menu on the left side of the screen you can move between all of these things and get use to all of the perks that the site makes available to you. Remember if you have any questions with a certain type of University of Memphis technology you can make an appointment with any technology coach, and we will be more than happy to help you with that. For immediate help feel free to call the service desk at (901) 678-888 which is open 24/7. Thanks for reading! Leave a comment | Feb 28 2015 Midterms! Posted by Dennis Tyler Stegall Hey Tigers, Unfortunately midterms on right around the corner, and I&#8217;m here to let you know about perks you have as University of Memphis students that will get you through Midterms with good grades.  Luckily for us students, the University of Memphis has supplies us with countless amenities that will allow us to succeed in earning our education, and more immediately, through midterms. The first of many benefits that will get you through midterms are the University&#8217;s collaboration rooms.  One of the best ways to study is done by reviewing and discussing material with your peers. Because of that, the UoM has several locations throughout the campus that are equipped with things such as dry erase boards, huge monitors that can be accessed by students and seen by everyone in the group, electrical outlets for those who want to bring their own computer, and much more! These rooms are free to you and are located conveniently throughout the campus. These include: 1. The Tech Hub   Open 24/7 Rooms must be reserved Also access to numerous computers and printers 2. McWherther Library Long hours which can be found by clicking here Rooms are on the Second and Third Floor Most rooms DO NOT require a reservation. **Both of these locations, and many more on campus are also equipped with computer labs and printers for your convenience. The final amenity I will talk about is the Educational Support Program (ESP) service.  This service one provided by the University so that students are able to find groups experiencing the same problems they are, and work together in order to help you understand complicated concepts.  There are several centers with tutoring in countless subjects; these include: Business Learning Center, English Learning Center, Math Learning Center, Science Learning Center, and many more. Click here for detailed information on meeting times, and other ESP related services. Leave a comment | Jan 23 2015 Student Advantage Posted by Dennis Tyler Stegall Hey guys, I want to let you know about the new software U of M Students are now being offered! At the University of Memphis we as students are offered many different resources so that we may successfully earn a degree using countless types of technology.  It is with pleasure that I recommend a new beneficial resource which the University is offering at no expense to you; we are calling it Student Advantage. Now, upon registering with the university, students will receive access to important Office software including: Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Why call it &#8220;Student Advantage&#8221;?  As students, professors require that you use software such as this to complete assignments such as essays, presentations, and documents encompassing a lot of data.  By providing this software, the University is giving students a huge advantage by allowing them to flourish in classes which require critical work,  make students more valuable in the working world, and my favorite part, save them a lot of money! In the first year of their college career, 38% of students will write 10 or more papers, anywhere between 5 and 19 pages; how can a student be expected to write that many papers cramped up in a library late at night? (lafayette.edu)  Instead, the University is allowing its students to download Office Software so that they may work in a more comfortable environment where there is much less inconvenience and stress. On top of that, students will now be able to meet up in a study group at anytime in order to complete group assignments such as PowerPoint Presentations. Through this advantage, students will eliminate a lot of stress and be one step closer to successfully earning their degree. This opportunity will make you more valuable as an employee as well.  Because you are able to work these programs, you will be able to satisfy requirements at work in an efficient manner, ultimately adding to one&#8217;s value in the work world. Microsoft reports that one in four of its enterprise customers have purchased Office 365; why is everyone be buying this software?  The software equips you with tools that will allow you to thrive in countless circumstance, whether they are at home or at work.  It allows you to efficiently look through emails with Outlook, organize information and take good notes with OneNote, create excellent documents using Word, and allows you to manage data and create helpful charts using Excel. Office is a treasured resource which we should all utilize. Finally, as I am sure you know, Office is not cheap.  For a Microsoft Office 365, you may pay anywhere between $70 per computer or $100 for a limited number of installations; I&#8217;m not sure about you but I cannot afford that!  Fortunately the University is equipping its students with these tools for free and I strongly encourage each of you to take advantage of Student Advantage. Here is how you get it: Go to , and click the orange &#8220;Install Now&#8221; button.  That is it! Thanks for checking out the blog, for more helpful tips or advice using any university technology, make an appointment with a Technology Coach like myself at  . Your Friend, Tyler Stegall Leave a comment | Nov 13 2014 Winter Break and Finals Week Posted by Sarah White Good things come to those who work hard. Winter Break is quickly approaching, but first.. FINALS WEEK. Wouldn’t it be nice if you had someone to give you helpful tips that would make finals week a little easier? Well, that’s what I’m here for! When it comes down to it, the only way to prepare for finals week is eat, sleep, study, study, study. Lucky for you, I have some tips that will make studying a little easier and A LOT more beneficial for you. 1. Location and study groups. Grab 3-5 DEDICATED people that need to study just as much as you do. Not only do you need to be able to study in a quiet, peaceful place, you need to have more than one place to study. •Lucky for you, the University of Memphis has collaboration rooms where you can study with a group of people. You can find the Tech Hub in the UC and McWherther Library. 2. Switch subjects. Don’t study the same material for hours and hours. Study one subject, then 30 minutes later, study something else. When you get back to what you started with, your brain will be slightly refreshed and ready to pick up where you left off. •Most of your professors will have their PowerPoint or notes on eCourseware. You will find yourself doing better if you look over and study those when it comes to finals. If you don’t know how to access or find things on eCourseware, you can ask me anything you need to know. 3. Sleep and snack well. I’m sure you all know that 6-8 hours of sleep is essential, but did you know that it’s been proven to raise your GPA up to a WHOLE letter grade? As tempting as it is to grab a candy bar to take with you in case you get hungry while you’re studying, don’t. Snack on fruits and/or vegetables, drink water, and if you need a little caffeine, go get a cup of coffee. Now that we got all that out of the way, don’t forget to register for Spring ’15 classes! For many of you, it will only be the second time you&#8217;ve registered. You can start registering on November 17, 2014. Your advisor will have most of the answers for any questions you have, but if you have any questions you forgot to ask them, contact me, your Technology Coach, and I would be glad to help you! Leave a comment | Aug 12 2014 Back to School! Posted by Hanna Davey Welcome Freshmen! It&#8217;s about that time of the year where you all begin your new journey towards your future. Now my question to you is, &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; As a freshman, you have ten times more to prepare for. For instance: Have you looked up to see what books you need for classes? Have you chosen your meal plan? Have you figured out where your classes are yet? Do you know how to access the technology needed for certain classes? These are just a few concerns that incoming freshman need to have answered yes too for a smooth sailing first semester. If you find yourself answering &#8216;No&#8217; to any of these questions, then this is why I am here. If you even find yourself puzzled about other stuff like tutoring services and locations, then please feel free to ask. I am here to help guide you through your first year. So don&#8217;t be afraid to ask me anything. I look forward to hearing from you all!! Leave a comment | Page 1 of 2 1 2 Search for: Recent Posts Homecoming!
