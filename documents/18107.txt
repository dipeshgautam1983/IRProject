Advising for Spring 2016, Discover Your Major Day &#8211; October 1, Withdrawal deadline, Graduation in 2016 Posted on September 23, 2015 by Patsy A Krech &#149; Leave a comment Advising for Spring 2016 Classes   All undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences are required to meet with their advisor prior to registration for classes for Spring 2016.  Your advisor may have sent you information about how to set up an appointment, and if so, follow the directions given. If you have not received an e-mail about advising, please contact your advisor to set up a meeting soon- if you have not already done so.  The document at the following link tells you how and when to make an appointment with our Arts and Sciences advisors: UM-Lambuth students will be advised on the Lambuth campus; please contact mccoy@memphis.edu if you do not know how to contact your advisor on the Lambuth campus. You can locate your advisor’s name through the Academic Advising and Planning channel on the Student tab on your myMemphis portal or at the top of UMdegree. If your advisor is not listed in myMemphis or UMdegree and you do not know who it is, please check Finding Your Advisor . If you need assistance determining who your advisor is, please e-mail pakrech@memphis.edu . If you are considering changing majors and need assistance, this webpage may help you: Prepare for your meeting with your advisor. Your advisor may ask you to check the degree evaluation, UMdegree, available on the Student tab in your myMemphis portal before your meeting. If your advisor has given you a degree sheet to use for posting your classes, be sure to update it with the courses you are enrolled in this semester and take it to your meeting.  If your advisor did not give you a degree sheet, you may use the appropriate version of one of our degree sheets (based on the Undergraduate Catalog you are under) to post your completed coursework: Registration begins November 9 and is based on classification. For the best chance of creating an ideal schedule, you should set up an advising appointment in the next few weeks so that you will be ready for your first opportunity to register. 1st Day to Register: Degree Seeking Graduate &amp; Post Bachelors Honors Students Veterans November 9, 2015 Seniors November 10, 2015 Juniors November 11, 2015 Sophomores November 12, 2015 Freshmen November 16, 2015 Seeing your advisor early will ensure that you can get an appointment before time to register.  Those who wait until November to schedule an appointment may not be able to see their advisor until after their first registration opportunity. Many advisors are not as available after Fall semester exams due to other commitments, so please go ahead and see your advisor during the next few weeks and register for classes on time. The “Schedule of Classes” for Spring 2016 and “Look-Up Classes” in myMemphis will soon be available for students to view, but there may still be some changes made.  The Schedule will be final on October 14, 2015.

Apply to Graduate: Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should apply to graduate at the beginning of the semester a year before their expected graduation date, for example, in September 2015 for graduation in Fall 2016. If you plan to graduate in May, August, or December 2016, and have not yet applied to graduate, you should apply to graduate NOW by going to myMemphis, the My Degree tab, and the Commencement and Graduation channel. Applying to graduate is free and takes only a few minutes. The University’s absolute deadline to apply to graduate in May 2016 is November 11, 2015 , and we do not allow exceptions to this deadline. If you have applied to graduate in May, August or December 2016, it takes a few months to receive a summary because they are completed in the order in which your application was received. If you applied to graduate in May, August, or December 2016, and now realize you won’t be able to graduate until a later semester, please send me an e-mail telling me your new expected graduation term. If you have any questions, I am happy to help. Wishing you a happy, safe Fall Break- October 10-13 for full session courses!

Go to Class&#8212; Early Intervention Posted on August 31, 2015 by Patsy A Krech &#149; Leave a comment I hope the first week of classes has gone well for all of our Arts and Sciences majors, and that you are getting into a routine that includes attending all of your classes!  You have probably heard from many sources that going to class is critical for college success. The University of Memphis faculty and advisors participate in a program called Early Intervention as a means of helping students to succeed.  Students who miss class or tests or do not submit assignments are submitted for Early Intervention, which means receiving an e-mail encouraging the student to take advantage of professors&#8217; office hours and other resources on campus.  The student&#8217;s advisor receives a notice of the Early Intervention report also and will be happy to work with students to get on track for success. If you receive an Early Intervention in the next few weeks, feel free to contact me if you have questions or don&#8217;t know what resources you can utilize: pakrech@memphis.edu.
