A mask aligner is an instrument enabling photolithography (also called optical lithography), which is a microfabrication process used to selectively remove parts of a thin film to create a pattern or a design onto a substrate. To generate this pattern, the substrate is first coated with a light-sensitive chemical (photoresist, or simply "resist"). (Coating of the substrate with a resist can be performed with the Laurell WS 650 Spin Coater present at the IMC.) The substrate is then introduced into the mask aligner and a mask with the desired pattern is placed above the substrate. A high intensity ultraviolet light is shined over the mask. The light only transmits through the openings in the pattern allowing the pattern to evaporate corresponding areas of the photoresist layer of the substrate. Silicon wafers are common substrates and a commonly used resist is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Mask aligners are widely used to generate integrated electronic circuits, specialty photonics materials and microfluidic channels.
