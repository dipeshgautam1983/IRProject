Physics Physics is a broad and complex field that uses mathematical models of nature to explain the nature and behavior of all manner of physical systems from the smallest particles inside the nucleus to the entire universe in which we live. The Dep artment of Physics and Materials Science has an expert faculty that reflects the diversity of opportunities available within the discipline. Research areas currently being investigated include astrophysics, solar physics, biomaterials, nanoscience, conden sed matter physics, applications of fractional calculus, and molecular computing. The department prides itself on the individual attention it gives its majors. Your academic and research advisors will work with you to design a curriculum and research prog ram that will meet your needs today and tomorrow. Many jobs require problem solving skills, including those in Engineering, Law, and Business. Opportunities include research physics, electro - optic engineering, patent law, and radiation protection adminis tration. Physics is a large and versatile field that can extend to academia, industry, and/or government.
