Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree BBA omes.pdf Course Methodology The course content delivery will be based on interactive lectures, in - class activities, group discussion boards, guest speakers, and written individual assignments. The goal is to assist students in learning more about leadership in order to develop effec tive self - leadership strategies and ultimately develop a self - leadership development plan. In eCourseware, please become familiar with our course home page. There I will post additional reading opportunities which may help you in your SLAP paper and o ther class activities. The Sample APA papers, with APA online links, are also posted there. My expectations for student s in this online course include the following. Specifically, I expect that: a) I expect that you will commit the n ecessary time to stay current in the course. By doing so, your potential for success is much higher. This step includes reading the syllabus and Assignment Summ ary carefully, printing out the syllabus and the course schedule, and reviewing the course content found in the modules. b) You will demonstrate critical thinking in the assignments. c) You will positively participate in class discussion board activities. d) This c ourse is largely based on written assessments in papers and projects. I expect that you will use the course resources such as Sample Papers and the APA resource links to help you prepare your papers. e) You will submit assignments on time barring an emergenc y or illness, late papers are not accepted. If you have a valid problem, please contact me individually. f) You will review the electronic feedback provided for papers in Grademark so that you can enhance your papers throughout the course. g) You will let me kn ow what you do not understand AFTER you have thoroughly read the instructions for the assignments. h) I expect that you review, edit, and proof your work prior to submitting. Student's Expectations What can you expect from me? a) If I have not returned an email within 24 hours, I did not receive your email. Please check the address and re - send your message. b) You can expect me to grade thoroughly and provide feedback online on your papers to help you improve your grade s on upcoming papers . c) You can also expect me to be available to help you however I need to hear from you as to the type of help you may need. I need clear questions in your emails please be sure to identify the course information carefully. Attendance and Participation You are expected to attend class regularly and be highly participative. If you have only two absen ces and a 90% grade by the due date of the Reflection #4, you will not have to submit that paper. Be in class and do your work well and get this reward for good work in the class! Grading and Evaluation Criteria The course will include written papers, discussion board activities, and in - class group projects for the semester grades. In lieu of a final, a SLAP (Self - Leadership Action Plan) will be required. The SLAP is both a paper and a presentation for each stud ents. Points are calculated through eCourseware to adjust for rounding. The following categories show the points necessary for each letter grade. G r a d i ng S ca l e: Points Earned Grade Range Letter Grade 815 - 905 90 - 100% A 724 - 814 80 - 89% B 634 - 723 70 - 79% C 543 - 633 60 - 69% D 542 and lower Less than 60% F Final Course Grades For all written papers, I use Turnitin.com and will post comments directly on your papers. To Grademark and helps you immediately see where you need to make changes for your future papers. Turnitin.com also is a plagiarism detector and if your similarity sco re is over approximately 17%, I will be looking at your sources and paper carefully.

The U of M Library also has a number of excellent databases, such as ProQuest and The course texts may be used in addition to your researched sources. You should cite and reference the texts as well as your outside sources. APA should be used throughout the semester. You are to use 2 outside sources , excluding your text, Mastering Self - Leadership, which is the primary text for the reflection papers. Rebooting Leadership may be used for the reflection papers but does not count as one of your 2 outside sources. When you research outside sources, seek to find sources that have been published within the last 5 years. Use scholarly journals for your sources the goal is to learn more about what is published recently about leadership. You will submit your papers through the dropbox. Check the course schedule for due dates. Submission time for all reflection papers i s 11:59 p.m. of the assignment due date. Wikipedia cannot be used for the Reflection Papers, Discussion Posts, or the Final Project for sources. Leadership websites, though helpful and informative, cannot be used as your two primary outside sources. If you use them in addition to your two external sources, be sure to cite appropriately. Your reflection papers and your discussion board assignments will alternate in due dates; you will not have both of these on assignments on the same week. Arranging the assignments in this way is designed to help you really focus on each assignment and prepare quality work. Review the syllabus, and the course schedule carefully each week for the assignments and due dates. Grading How will you be graded on the reflection papers? I will be evaluating these papers on de m on s t r a t e d k no w l e d g e o f t h e m a t e r i a l , c r i t i c a l t h i n k i n g / c on c l u s i on s , po t e n t i a l f o r pe r s o na l i m pa c t , professionalism, writing quality, r e l e v a n ce t o s e l f - l e a d e r s h i p , & appropriate r e f e r e n c e s . F o rm a t : A P A , d o ub l e - spaced , 1 m a r g i n s all sides, T i m e s N e w R o m a n font, 12 type size . Proof and spellcheck! Writing errors will count! Refer to the sample paper provided in the Getting Started section. Include a cover page with each assignment Name of student, course, name of assignment, date. See APA cover page format in the links provided, OWL has great sample paper examples with cover pages. (OWL is the Online Writing Center from Perdue University) Sample APA Paper Review the sample Reflection Papers carefu lly. Writing errors will count apply what you learned in Business Communication (Mgmt 3510) in terms of report writing, references and citations, and scholarly writing. There are outside sources to help you apply APA appropriately. These links are inclu ded in the sample APA paper. Supportive Sources: As college seniors, you should be seeking strong sources for your reflection papers. Appropriate sources, properly cited and referenced per APA, will also be a grading component. Evaluate your sources ca refully. Use the following points to evaluate your sources for each reflection paper and your final project: Credible is your source credible? As a journal, is it a scholarly work? (Examples: The Journal of Management is a credible source, The Memphis Fl yer, for this purpose, is probably not a credible source). Relevant does the source relate well to the weekly reading content? Recent and Timely try to use sources that are written within the last five years Remember, searching articles on the internet is much like going to the library. It takes some time to review the content and make sure that the article is right for your use. Allow time to seek appropriate articles. Keep a folder with the sources you use they might be helpful for your final pro ject. Intro Assignment Our first assignment will be a short written assignment which introduces you to the class and to me. Instructions will be posted in the course home page for this assignment. The purpose of the introductory assignment is to int roduce yourself to your group and to me. In addition, it gives you some early points in the class and provides a means for you to see my feedback to you I will grade these but will give you more leniency in these assignments so you see my grading style. F i n a l P ro j ec t The requirements for this project will be given in class.
