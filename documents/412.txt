Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree BBA pdf These learning outcomes will be integrated within our course assignments. Course Methodology As an online course, the course is developed into modules so that students can move through the course sequentially with each module building on the previous module. By the end of the course, the content will prepare the student for the final SLAP Project. Quizzes, reflection papers, discussion board assignments, assessments, and video segments provide the learning format for the course. My expectations for student s in this online course include the following. Specifically, I expect that: a) As an online student, you will commit the necessary time (often significantly more than an on - ground course) to stay current in the course. By doing so, your potential for success is much higher. This step includes reading the syllabus and Assignment Summary carefully, printing out the syllabus and the course schedule, and reviewing the course content found in the modules. b) You will demonstrate critical thinking in the assignments. c) You will positively participate in class discus sion board activities. d) This course is largely based on written assessments in papers and projects. I expect that you will use the course resources such as Sample Papers and the APA resource links to help you prepare your papers. e) You will submit assignment s on time barring an emergency or illness, late papers are not accepted. If you have a valid problem, please contact me individually. f) You will review the electronic feedback provided for papers in Grademark so that you can enhance your papers throughout t he course. g) You will let me know what you do not understand AFTER you have thoroughly read the instructions for the assignments. h) I expect that you review, edit, and proof your work prior to submitting. Student's Expectations What can you expect from me? a) If I have not returned an email within 24 hours, I did not receive your email.

All students are supposed to remember online etiquette in terms of communication in discussion board activities and assignments. Here are some specific forms of behavior expected in email communications. A lw a ys i n c l u d e a s ub j e c t li n e . Do not email assignments unless we have spoken regarding the reason to email vs using the eCourseware system. These assignments will not be graded unless we have agreed to do so as it causes a disconnect in the eCourseware tracking of the assignment.

These will be announced through the course news page Reporting Illness or Absences As an online course, you have flexibility to work around schedule interruptions by working o n projects at your own pace. However, if you have a major life issue (major illness, death in the family, etc) then please alert me if it will interrupt your ability to function successfully in the class. Inclement Weather As an online course, inclement w eather should not affect deadlines overall. I will post any changes that may apply should inclement weather occur.

Student Services Please access the FCBE Student Services page for information about : Students with Disabilities Tutoring and other Academic Assistance Advising Services for Fogelman Students Technical Assistance The Complete Pr ofessional Program, Course Format and Assignment Information Course Format The course is divided into modules. Within each module, you will have your reading assignments, a quiz assignment, and any additional information such as a video clip, instructor PowerPoint, etc. Be sure to review each module carefully. Though similar i n format, each module is a bit different based on whether you have a reflection paper or discussion board entry. Quizzes Check the quiz open dates each week these quizzes are over the reading material in Neck & Manz and will help you reflect upon the re es close within approximately 48 hours so plan your week to: First read the material assigned for each module. Take the quiz soon after reading the chapter; these are not open - book quizzes. Finish the other assignments due in each respective module. The quiz is to assess your comprehension of the reading it is not open book! The quizzes are scored by the system and your grade appears quickly. Due to the shortness of the quizzes, there is only one opportunity to submit your answers. Do not wait until the last minute in case you run out of time; when the quiz closes, it closes ! Quizzes cannot be made up so plan accordingly. If you have an emergency such as a severe illness or death in your family, I will work with you individually. However, just missing the deadline does not constitute a make - up opportunity.

For the discussion board assignments, I will post 2 - 3 questions about leadership. You will be expected to respond with an appropriate response that relates to the course material for that week. Your first post is your individual post. You will also be asked to share your perspectives with others by commenting on each the material and their insights. As a leader, you will be leading different types of people. Reviewing different perspectives in this class will help to prepare you for the different perspectives of the people you may lead. Your follow - up posts are you r group posts. As a general rule, your individual discussion posts should be approximately 2 - 3 well - written paragraphs, cited and referenced with APA. Your responses to your group members should be approximately 1 - 4 sentences of meaningful information. Remember that these discussion posts are like being in class know the material, read the comments carefully, and respond with senior - level responses. Allow time to do these posts well review the questions posted for each discussion board assignment caref ully and review your answers. Repeat the question in your post it will help you stay on track with your answer. You will be in the same group for the full s ummer 2 term. See the Group Assignment List in While your individual post is more formal, like an essay question, your group responses can be more informal. All posts however should be proofed for grammar, spelling, and ot her writing errors. Writing and oral communication are the two top skills requested by employers practicing your writing with all assignments will help you become a strong writer. Submission: You will post your discussion answer to each question on Thur sday by 11:59 p.m. This individual submission/post is worth 10 points. By Saturday evening of the same week, you will post your reaction to the members of your group by 11:59 p.m. This group response submission is worth 10 points . The total value of t he two submissions is 20 points. There are a total of 5 discussions in the semester including the Intro Discussion Post. this delay affects your group members! Be on time, plan your week accordingly . Your individual post grade will also include timeliness of your post. How will you be graded? You will be graded on your complete response to the question for your individual response. Your response should show critical thinking and application of the course content to the question. You will be graded on your group response for your appropriate r esponses to their content and by adding value to the conversation read your group member comments carefully and respond with a well - developed response. preciate your thoughts on goal setting for leaders. I particularly thought Text Support For Discussion Posts There are two texts for the course. You will have a reading assignment from each text each week. The text, Rebooting Leadership, will be the required text for the Discussion Posts . You can refer to both texts but the Rebooting Leadership is the primary source for the Discussion Posts. Before you prepare your post for the discussion, be sure to watch the corresponding video clip from one of our authors, Bill Catlette. These video clips are found in the respective discussion board areas , right above the questions. You should be able to open the videos with no issues however, depending on your internet service it may take varying amounts of time. They are listed through ensemble video , on the U of M server. They are also available thr ough my Vimeo account. Discussion Board Assignment Summary Each discussion post is worth up to 20 points. To earn the full 20 points, you must: a) answer the questions posted for each discussion board thoroughly individually. You should reference the text, using APA style, for each weekly individual post (10 points). b) respond to your group and have an interactive discussion with your group (10 points). You should read the posts from your group members and respond based on their content and contributions. P ositive, appropriate communication should be used for each post.

For your two required outside sources, use journal articles such as The Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies. Professional publications such as Forbes and Inc can be used but try to have at least one scholarly journal for each paper. Websites may be used only as additional resources, not your primary resources. Remember part of what you are doing is demonstrating that you have researched and read more about l eadership. Dates of your outside sources should be within the last 6 years so no publications with print/publication dates of 2007 or earlier. Wikipedia cannot be used for the Reflection Papers, Discussion Posts, or the Final Project for sources. The course texts may be used in addition to your researched sources. You should cite and reference the texts as well as your outside sources. APA should be used throughout the semester. You are to use 2 outside sources , excluding your text, Mastering Self - L eadership, which is the primary text for the reflection papers. Rebooting Leadership may be used for the reflection papers but does not count as one of your 2 outside sources. You will submit your papers through the dropbox. Check the course schedule fo r due dates. Time for all reflection paper submission is 11:59 p.m. of the assignment due date. Word of Caution: Do not wait too close to the closing date of the dropbox. Often students have earlier deadline. Often the UM system is overloaded with so many students trying to submit and it will keep you from having access to the dropbox. Your reflection papers and your required discussion board assignments will alternate in due dates; you will have a paper one week and a discussion board assignment the next week. Grading How will you be graded on the reflection papers? I will be evaluating these papers on de m on s t r a t e d k no w l e d g e o f t h e m a t e r i a l , c r i t i c a l t h i n k i n g / c on c l u s i on s , po t e n t i a l f o r pe r s o na l i m pa c t , professionalism, writing quality, r e l e v a n ce t o s e l f - l e a d e r s h i p , & appropriate r e f e r e n c e s . F o rm a t : A P A , d o ub l e - spaced , 1 m a r g i n s all sides, T i m e s N e w R o m a n font, 12 type size . Proof and spellcheck! Writing errors will count! Refer to the sample paper provided in the Getting Started section. See the APA resources in the Content section. Include a cover page with each assignment Name of student, course, name of assignment, date. See APA cover page format in the links provided, OWL has great sample paper examples with cover pages. Sample APA Paper Review the sample Reflection Papers carefully. Writing errors will count apply what you learned in Business Communication (Mgmt 3510) in terms of report writing, references and citations, and scholarly writing. There are outside sources to help you apply APA appropriately. These links are included in the sample APA paper. Supportive Sources: As college seniors, you should be se eking strong sources for your reflection papers. Appropriate sources, properly cited and referenced per APA, will also be a grading component. Evaluate your sources carefully. Use the following points to evaluate your sources for each reflection paper an d your final project: Credible is your source credible? As a journal, is it a scholarly work? (Examples: The Journal of Management is a credible source, The Memphis Flier, for this purpose, is probably not a credible source). Relevant does the source relate well to the weekly reading content? Recent and Timely are my sources timely, written primarily within the last six years ? Remember, searching articles on the internet is much like going to the library. It takes some time to rev iew the content and make sure that the article is right for your use. Allow time to seek appropriate articles. Keep a folder with the sources you use they might be helpful for your final project. Grading Feedback I will be using Turnitin.com and will mak e comments directly on your my notes. Review this feedback and apply notice an improvement in future papers. Intro Assignment Our first assignment will be a two - fold assignment. First, you must go to the Content page and listen to my Introductory PowerPoint presentation on leadership. This document is a narrated PowerPoint that will hopefully let you learn a little more about l eadership as well as introduce you to me. You will be submitting a narrated PowerPoint presentation as part of your final project so this is a sample for you as well. After you have reviewed the PowerPoint, go to the Introductory Assignment in the Conte nt Page and follow the directions for this first assignment. See the Introductory Assignment in the Getting Started section. This assignment has two parts an individual post in the discussion board and a response to your group members. Proof and spellch eck your posts carefully. You will respond to your group members in t he Discussion Forum by group. See the Introductory Assignment your group members as well as post your initial responses to my Intro PowerPoint. F i n a l P ro j ec t The final project consists of both a written paper and a narrated audio PowerPoint presentation. Your final paper should follow the same APA requirements as the Reflection Papers and should be proofed carefully. Your final written paper should be approximately 4 - 5 pages in length and your PowerPoint presentation should be a minimum of 12 slides, approximately 5 - 8 minutes of recorded content.
