U.S. News & World Report has again nationally ranked the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders as having top graduate programs in both Audiology and Speech-Language Patho logy. For its 2015 rankings, U.S. News analyzed more than 1,300 graduate programs and placed the University’s program in Au diology 12th nationally and the program in Speech-Language Pathology 15th. “The School has been nationally ranked since 1998, and continually strives to stay on e step ahead of the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-science in its field,” said Dr. Maurice Mendel, dean of Communicatio n Sciences and Disorders. “The research laboratories and outstanding team of research personnel currently have almost $4 mill ion in external funding to maintain our Center of Excellence (the Center for Research Initiatives and Strategies for the Comm unicatively Impaired) in the study of communicative disorders.” Modern Healthcare magazine has ranked the University of Memphis’ Master of Health Administration progra m 19th among top business graduate schools for physician-executives.

Earth Day will celebrate animal conservation Presenters from the Memphis Zoo will have a prominent role in Earth Day 2014 at the U niversity of Memphis on April 17, and rightly so: the theme of this year’s event is animal conserv ation. “We are so excited to have the Memphis Zoo participate in this year’s event,” says Ka ryl Buddington, U of M veterinarian and a coordinator of the U of M’s Earth Day. “Zoos promote animal c onservation at their facilities as well as in the wild. Given the dwindling numbers of different animal groups, it is important to promote awareness of animal conservation.” The event runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the TIGUrS Urban Garden behind the Elma Roan e Fieldhouse and is co-hosted by the U of M’s Office of Sustainability. There will be live music and free food. “We will have animal conservation groups who will explain their organizations at boot hs that will be located around the garden,” Buddington says. “There also will be interactive educational activities as w ell as annual U of M Earth Day traditions such as Tai Chi, Zumba, yoga, planting activities, local vendors and much more.” The schedule includes talks on polar bear conservation at 11 a.m., primate conservati on at 2 p.m. and penguin conservation at 2:30 p.m. Lunch will be served beginning at 11 a.m., and there will be a butterfly release at 12:30 p.m. U of M's continued safety record reflected in TBI report For the fifth time in the past seven years, the University of Memphis has the lowest crime rate of the 10 large universities, both public and private, in Tennessee. According to the Tennessee Bureau of Investiga tion’s 2013 Crime on Campus report, the U of M had an incident rate of 14 per 1,000 campus population. The average for th e 10 large schools was 23.5 incidents per 1,000. Large campuses are those with more than 5,000 students. The full report is available online at .“The tremendous work our detectives have done helped lower crime on our campus 15.3 p ercent last year,” said Bruce Harber, U of M chief of police. Contributing to the consistently low incident rate is the University’s Police Service s Department; the use of technology, including more than 600 Internet-based video cameras; and the U of M’s steadfast comm itment to safety.
