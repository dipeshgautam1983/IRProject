Your explanation should attempt to show why an exception to the published policy is justified. Requests that simply disagree with the policy are usually not granted. The University refund policy is based entirely upon the official date of the withdrawal or change of course which would result in a refund. Refunds beyond the specified dates or percentages indicated in the &quot;Schedule of Classes&quot; will not be made for reasons such as employment conflict, health or medical problems, moving out of town, or other reasons which are beyond the University's control or responsibility. 4. If you are requesting an exception to the policy stated above, PLEASE SUBMIT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION WITH THIS FORM. For example, a statement from an advisor is needed when an advising error is the basis of the request; a statement from a medical professional on letterhead and including applicable dates is required when based on a medical condition.

The Bursar's Office will determine if proper University policies have been followed and may make an adjustment based on their review; a written decision will be sent to the EMAIL address listed on this form* .
