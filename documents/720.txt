On the junior and senior level, the Department of English offers an honors track open only to English majors, who are eligible to apply for admission to the program if they have a grade point average of 3.25 in their overall studies and in English. Honors students take special courses during their junior and senior years and write a senior honors thesis. Those students who complete the program and the regular college requirements will be recognized at the commencement ceremony by having their degree conferred "With Honors in English." Moreover, the student's diploma and the record at the University of Memphis will reflect this distinction. Details of the program are available at the Department of English office. English Minor Completion of 12 upper division hours in English (excluding ENGL 3500 and 3603). Accelerated B.A./M.A. Program in English This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Arts in English during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.A./M.A. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of English. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.A. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.A. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the English department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in English. Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.A./M.A. program, which allows them to take graduate courses in English. To continue in the program past the B.A., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the English department's M.A. program. Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply to undergraduate GPA.
