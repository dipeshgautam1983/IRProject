Betsy&#8217;s distinguished 32-year tenure at the University Libraries at the University of Memphis was an inspiration to the faculty, staff, and students she served enthusiastically first as a reference librarian, then as Head of Reference, and finally as Assistant to the Dean for Planning and Assessment. Betsy modeled the characteristics she expected in other Libraries faculty: Intellectual inquisitiveness, service to others, and the drive to contribute meaningfully to the profession. In addition to her oft-cited publication, &#8220;Status of the Profession: A 1989 National Survey of Tenure and Promotion for Policies for Academic Librarians&#8221; ( College and Research Libraries , May 1991, 275-289), Betsy authored a book chapter and many journal articles, regularly presented her work at state and national conferences, and was active in a variety of professional organizations. She was a respected colleague; Libraries faculty and staff actively sought her advice and counsel. Her door was always open, and she went out of her way to welcome and mentor junior faculty members. In her role as Head of Reference, Betsy was a strong and charismatic leader; she was always available, fair, and encouraging to members of the Department. She was a dedicated chair of the Libraries Tenure and Promotion Committee and created a writing group to facilitate and support the scholarship of Libraries faculty. Betsy lived to teach, and in addition to her innumerable presentations in classrooms, often invited students and faculty to her office to help with research-related questions. Colleagues nearby could often hear exclamations of delight as Betsy shared with her visitors new perspectives, research skills, and ways to use technology. Betsy never shied away from challenges, whether professional or personal. She was an innovative, insightful, and reliable collaborator. She was among the first librarians at the University to present online instruction to distance learning students and to be embedded in online classes, and became the go-to person for questions about RefWorks, the citation management software. Her adventurous spirit led her to serve as a Peace Corps volunteer in Gossas, Senegal, from 1966-1968; more recently, she and her husband reveled in the cultures of South Korea, Japan, France, and Hawaii. A fabulous chef and hostess, Betsy was known for dishes inspired by the culinary experiences she had while traveling. She threw great dinner parties, made pots of homemade applesauce with her granddaughters (one of her favorite traditions), and amassed an impressive collection of cookbooks. Betsy routinely shared produce from her bountiful garden, was often spotted at the Symphony and the Overton Shell, and was an avid golfer at one time. The songs of love birds filled her home, and she loved&#8211;and adopted&#8211;many dogs over the years (each a character, it seemed!). Everyone who knew her has a favorite &#8220;Betsy story.&#8221; Won&#8217;t you share yours? Posted in Homepage , News , Uncategorized | 11 Comments | Dec 17 2014 Celebrating a successful semester! Posted by jschnbel The faculty and staff of the University Libraries wish you pleasant and relaxing Winter Break and a happy New Year! Congratulations to the December 2014 graduates and their families. For our interim hours, please click here . Don&#8217;t forget to visit our exhibition, &#8220; From Active Duty to Veteran: Honoring Military Service in America ,&#8221; on view in the rotunda and on the fourth floor of McWherter Library until January 16. The Libraries continues to encourage and support undergraduate research at the University of Memphis. This semester, the Libraries was part of two honors research forums taught by Dr. Pam Dennis and Cody Behles. Professor Dennis&#8217; class, &#8220;Surviving the Research Blues: A Historical Approach,&#8221; focused on local history and civil rights issues. The students consulted the Libraries&#8217; special collections and other primary resources to inform their final projects, which they presented at the December meeting of the West Tennessee Historical Society. Professor Behles introduced his students to issues concerning scholarly communication in the 21st century. The class spent time in the Memphis and Shelby County Room at the Memphis Public Library examining and mapping communication networks of Memphians throughout history. For more information about undergraduate research on campus, visit the web site of  QuaesitUM , a peer-reviewed annual publication that showcases students&#8217; work in all disciplines. Dr. Dennis and her UNHP 1100 students We&#8217;re pleased to announce we have subscribed to Browzine , an app which allows users to access our paid electronic periodical content through their mobile devices in a display that emulates physical bookshelves. Thank you to all across campus who participated in the trial; your feedback was appreciated. If you have not already, download the app and follow these instructions to start browsing the Libraries&#8217; collection of journals! Feel free to contact Cody Behles (cbehles@memphis.edu) with any questions. Finally, the University Libraries is thrilled to welcome Athena the tigress back to her home in front of McWherter Library.  Athena had been away receiving much needed repairs, and she returns to the University of Memphis as a powerful symbol of wisdom. We thank artist Pam Cobb and the Friends of the University Libraries for their generous support of her care. We look forward to serving our University of Memphis communities in 2015! Posted in Events , Exhibition , Homepage , News , Research and Instructional Services , Special Collections , Uncategorized | Leave a comment | Nov 21 2014 The Libraries Honors Veterans with Exhibition and Research Guide Posted by jschnbel Veterans Day Parade, Oct. 25, 1971, Memphis.    L-R: Chester Shields, 75, WWI veteran; Bob Reese, 22; Vietnam War veteran; Fred Bauer, 87, Spanish-American War veteran The University Libraries proudly presents &#8220;From Active Duty to Veteran: Honoring Military Service in America,&#8221; an exhibition of letters, maps, photographs, pamphlets, oral histories, posters, and ephemera from the Libraries&#8217; special collections and government publications departments. Displays are located on the first and fourth floors of McWherter Library and will be on view until January 16. Click here for the Libraries’ hours. The exhibition was the focus of a special Veterans Day lecture, “War, Peace, History, and Memory: Military Service in the American Experience,” presented by historian and cataloging librarian Dr. Mark Danley in McWherter Library. Danley, who helped choose materials from the collections to include in the displays, challenged our collective tendency to regard American military history as a narrative that merely &#8220;goes from war to war.&#8221; This simplified version of our experience, Danley argued, causes us to downplay the violence faced by our military personnel during other time periods of apparent peace (like the Cold War).  He suggested as examples the continued casualties on the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean peninsula since 1953. To illustrate his point further, Danley (a veteran himself) referred to a Press-Scimitar photograph from the Libraries&#8217; special collections taken during the 1971 Veterans Day Parade in Memphis. The poignant image features a Spanish War, a World War I, and Vietnam War veteran standing together, hands clasped. He remarked, however, that even though that grouping was clearly significant, the photographer would likely not think it as significant to capture a meeting between a veteran of the Vera Cruz campaign in 1914, a veteran of the U.S. garrison in Shanghai in the 1920s, and a veteran of the Berlin garrison of the 1960s. The reasons why underscore the point that the reality of American experience with military service is more variegated than common public impressions convey. A question and answer session followed the presentation, which was the final event of the daylong campus celebration of the nation&#8217;s veterans lead by the U of M Veterans Resource Center. Check back shortly to watch a video of Dr. Mark Danley&#8217;s full lecture. In addition to the physical displays in McWherter Library, visitors can access a comprehensive  online research guide for additional resources about the time periods covered in the exhibition. We thank the Friends of the University Libraries for their continued support of our exhibitions and programs.
