Then, for each term, brainstorm different forms of the word, synonyms, related terms, as well as narrower and broader terms. (See below.) Brainstorming for keywords is a process that will help increase your chances of finding information on your topic. College Students United States Saving money Young adults U.S. Savings Millennials America Budgeting Teenagers Investing Generation Y P ersonal Savings Savings Accounts Use only single words , or 2 or 3-word phrases when searching library databases. Do NOT use sentences or questions! Database searching is different from Google searching. Single words do NOT need quotation marks around them; sometimes it can be helpful to place quotation marks around 2 or 3-word phrases to keep them searched as a unique phrase that has meaning, instead of as individual words. Examples: ozone environment &ldquo;global warming&quot; &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; Try a broad search for your topic in one of our databases ( OmniFile is a good multidisciplinary database), to see how scholarly articles describe it. For example, if you are interested in learning environments and their impact on academic performance, type &quot;learning environments&quot; in the search box and click &quot;search&quot;. Browse the articles in your search results . When you see one that particularly interests you, or is a very close match for your specific topic, take a closer look at it. Click the article&#39;s title to view its full/detailed record , which will show you subject terms , and author-supplied keywords -- great sources for new search terms: Substitute SYNONYMS to see what results you get -- authors may choose different ways to describe a topic. Examples: &ldquo;right to die&rdquo; OR &ldquo;assisted suicide&rdquo; OR euthanasia required OR mandatory OR compulsory Combine keywords Combine terms with AND to narrow your focus. To find info about fur on dogs, search: fur AND dogs. Combine terms with OR to expand your focus. To find info about fur on either dogs or cats, search: fur AND (dogs OR cats). Use multiple search boxes: if you want to know: What is the effect on a dog&#39;s fur of eating fish You could use the database search boxes to enter: Media Chat Other Ways to Contact Us Comments (0) Add a public comment to this FAQ Entry University Libraries - The University of Memphis - Memphis, TN 38152 - 901-678-2205 Powered by Springshare ; All rights reserved.
