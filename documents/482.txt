Tax law affects and influences nearly every aspect of our lives, from sales tax, income tax, property tax, charitable deductions, tax credits and inheritance tax just to name a few areas. Students studying tax law will be able to apply their knowledge not only to their work but also to their daily decisions. In studying the Internal Revenue Service Code, students in the Certificate in Tax program develop and strengthen their critical thinking skills. Knowledge of the code is essential not only for tax practitioners, but also for attorneys practicing in various fields such as labor and employment, family law, insurance, social security, workers compensation, and corporate litigation.
