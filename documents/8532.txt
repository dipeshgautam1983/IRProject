Students will deal with HIPAA privacy issues relating to the disclosure of individually identifiable medical information and will deal with ethical situations involving clients with diminished capacity, medical decision making, and conservatorship. Students should expect some litigation and courtroom experience, as well as opportunities for advocacy before administrative agencies. In addition, as a component of the Clinic orientation and weekly case review class sessions, student attorneys will have the opportunity to interact with health care providers, non-profit agencies, and governmental units that are a part of the aging network and that deal with health care and the elderly, such as the Office of the Long Term Care Ombudsman, the Baptist Memory Care Center, and the Mid-South Coalition for Comfort Care and Bioethics. Finally, one-third of each student's grade will be based on that student's research, development and presentation of a community legal education program to a group of seniors concerning an elder health law issue of the student's choice.
