The Methodist Le Bonheur Center for Healthcare Economics July 2015 Health Policy Blog Primary Care in Tennessee: The Gap b etween Demand and Physician Supply I. What is the Problem? The availability of excellent primary care is central to high performing health care and favorable patient outcomes. Unfortunately , in many regions of the country, residents cannot find the care they want and need. While federal and state programs have made considerable progress in addressing the primary care needs of underserved populations, high quality primary care remains out of reach for many. 1 The demand for primary care in Tennessee, as in many other parts of the country, exceeds the availability of needed services. The Robert Graham Center has estimated that 56 million Americans cur rently lack adequate access to primary care. 2 This unmet health care demand is expected to increase substantially over the next few years as a result of population growth, the aging of the population, and the impacts of the Affordable Care Act and other forces on health insurance availability and health system functions. 3 The purpose of this report is to provide information on the health and economic consequences and extent of the current and future shortage of primary care physicians in Tenne ssee as a basis for considering evidence - based, effective public policy initiatives. 1 National Association of Community Health Cente rs and the Robert Graham Center, Access Denied: A Look at Americans Medically Disenfranchised (Washington, DC: The Robert Graham Center, March 2007 ) . 2 Ibid. 3 Bureau of Health Professions, Projecting the Supply and Demand for Primary Care Practitioners Through 2020 (Washington, DC: Health Resources and S ervices Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, November 2013 ) . Page | 2 II. What i s t he Current Status o f t he Primary Care Physician Workforce i n Tennessee? Who provides primary care? Primary care has traditionally been provided by physicians, including both medical physicians (MDs) and osteopathic physicians (DOs). These include physicians designated as general practitioners (GPs) and physicians with training in family medicine, gener al internal medicine, general pediatrics, and, in some states including Tennessee, general obstetrics - gynecology. A growing volume of primary care is also being provided by nonphysician clinicians, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants , and clinical pharmacists; the roles of these provide r s will be considered in subsequent reports on this site. In addition, a limited (less than 8 .0 % of primary care visits) and declining amount of primary care services is provided by medical and surgical spec ialists. 4 Exhibit 1 provides basic information about the current supply of primary care physicians (including both allopathic and osteopathic physicians) in Tennessee. Of the 15,494 active, office - based, nonfederal physicians engaged chiefly in patient care in 2012, 6,218 (40.1%) were in the primary care specialties of general practice (156, 2.5%), family medicine (1,917, 30.8%), general internal medicine (2,199, 35.4%), general pediatrics (1,120, 18.0%), and general obstetrics - gynecology (82 6, 13.3%). 5 Adequacy of current physician supply .

(Washington, DC: Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). states, 6 large regional differences and many areas of shortage exist. The number of primary care physicians per county ranged from zero in three counties (Lake, Moore, and Van Buren ) to 1,087 (in Shelby County). The population per primary care physician in the 92 counties with one or more primary care physician s ranged from 135 to 14,104 . One approach to assessing the adequacy of the primary care physician supply in a county was deve loped by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC), a research unit of the University of Minnesota. 7 In this scheme, a county was adequate than 1,500 residents per primary moderately inadequate 6 E.

In 2012, only 24 counties (25.3%) in Tennessee met the criteri on for an adequate supply of primary care physicians, 45 counties (47.4%) were deemed to have a moderately inadequate workforce , and 2 3 counties (24.2%) met the criterion for a low inadequate supply. As noted above, three counties (3.2%) had no primary care physicians. The data shown in Exhibit 2 also demonstrate that almost 40 .0 % of the state population (2,583,762 residents) lived in counties with an inadequate supply of primary care physicians. Counties with an adequate physician workforce were the largest in average population size (155,457 residents per county), followed by those with moderately inadequate (49,665 per county) and l ow inadequate supplies (17,857 per county); counties with no primary care physicians were the smallest in population size (6,538 per county). Rural counties predominated among those with less than adequate supplies . O nly one rural county had an adequate primary care physician workforce. In contrast, 14 of 42 metropolitan counties and 9 of 20 micropolitan counties were among the 24 counties with adequate levels. 8 Counties with moderately inadequate or low inadequate primary care physician supply had rel atively high proportions of residents in typically underserved or vulnerable populations and, hence, were likely in need of primary care services. These include older persons over 65 years of age, persons living in poverty, uninsured persons, and unemploy ed persons. 8 County designations were based on criteria of the U.S. Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget 2013 definiti ons of Core B ased Statistical Areas (CBSA): (a) metropolitan counties contain an urban core with a population of 50,000 or more ; (b) micropolitan counties include an urban core with a population of 10,000 to 50,000 ; and (c) rural counties do not fit either criteria.

The County Health Rankings Project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 9 summarizes the differences in health and socioeconomic status for the SHADAC subgro ups (Exhibit 3 ). Each cell reports the average rank of the counties in each group among all 95 counties in Tennessee for measures of quality of life, health behaviors, clinical care, and social and economic environment. The rankings indicate the composit e of several measures for each domain that reflect, together, the general health and socioeconomic conditions in a county in relation to the other 94 Tennessee counties. Higher rankings indicate less favorable measurements. The data indicate that health and socioeconomic conditions were best for the group of counties with an adequate primary care physician workforce and worst for counties with low inadequate workforce levels. 9 County Health Rankings , 2015 editi on (Washington, DC: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ), .

Why is a Shortage o f Primary Care Providers Important? The health care literature provides compelling evidence of the values of effective primary care and, hence, the problems that the existing gap between the demand for and the supply of primary care providers can create. The positive values of pri mary care include the following: Access to primary care improves personal and population health. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that regions with higher numbers of primary care physicians have improved health outcomes, including all - cause, heart disease, cancer, and stroke mortality rates; self - reported health status; low birth - weight births; life expectancy; and use of preventive care. 10 , 11 For example, an increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population has been associated with a 10 J .

Page | 7 5.3 percent reduction in all - cause deaths, potentially averting as many as 127,617 deaths in the United States each year. 12 Primary care reduces health care utilization and costs. Higher levels of primary care have been shown to be associated with lower numbers of avoidable hospitalizations, 13 early hospital readmissions, 14 and emergency department utilization for nonurgent cond itions. 15 In one report, the addition of one primary care physician per 10,000 population was associated with a reduction in 30 - day post - hospital discharge readmissions for pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure of 7 .0 percent , 5 .0 percent , and 8 .0 percent , respectively; adding one primary care physician per 100,000 population was estimated to reduce the cost of these readmissions by $1.7 million. The preponderance of data also document an inverse relation between primary care servi ces and overall health care costs; for example, Michael Chernew and associates reported that in 2005 a ten percentage point increase in the proportion of physicians practicing primary care was associated with a 9.2 percent reduction in Medicare spending pe r beneficiary. 16 Expanded primary care reduces racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care. The impacts of primary care on health are greater among socioeconomically - deprived, at - risk populations than among the general population. For example, the impact of added primary care physicians on all - cause mortality is four times greater among African - American populations than among whites. 17 Similarly, the impact may be greater in rural than in nonrural 12 Macinko et al 13 A.

The positive benefits of primary care described above als o ident ify opportunities for improvement with more adequate acce ss to primary care . These include the following : Chronic conditions amenable to primary care are common and undertreated in Tennessee. According to the Centers for Dise ase Control , 11.0 percent of adult Tennesseans have been diagnosed with diabetes, 34.0 percent have elevated cholesterol levels, 37.1 percent have hypertension, and 7.7 percent have asthma. 20 Tennessee also ranks 47 th among the states in the rate of obesity. 21 Thus, the opportunit ies for better treatment through primary care are substantial. The health care costs of these chronic conditions are high . It has been estimated that if every American utilized primary care, health care costs could be reduced by as much as $67 billion per year. 22 A 5 .0 percent reduction in the prevalence of only diabetes and hypertension, a change achievable by enhanced primary care that emphasizes prevention and lifestyle modification, could save $9 billion in the short term and over $24 billion over the longer term; estimates for savings in Tennessee are $199 million in the short term and $621 million longer term. 23 18 L.

Page | 9 The high prevalence of obesity in Tennessee has been estimated to add $3.7 billion to statewide health care costs. 24 Undertreatment leads to avoidable hospitalizati ons . The current limits of primary care are reflected in the high number of avoidable hospitalizations. These include hospital admissions for conditions that could be avoided by effective - sensitive admissions examples, admissions for asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and pneumonia. Among Medicare recipients, Tennessee ranks 46 th among the states in the rate of avoidable hospitalizations, with a rate of 73.1 admissions per 1,000 Medicare enrollee s a rate that is 1.6 times that of the state with the lowest rate. 25 These avoidable hospitalizations cost approximately $330 million each year nationally, with each avoidable hospitalization raising health care costs by over $8 , 700. 26 , 27 Gaps in p rimary ca re also lead to high emergency department (ED) use . Over 40 .0 percent of nonurgent ED visits are associated with deficiencies in primary care access, including long wait times, inconvenient office hours, and inability to find a primary care provider. 28 The health care costs of preventable ED visits total approximately $72 million yearly , or 42.1 percent of all ED charges. Primary care benefits the general economy . It has been estimated that each additional primary care physician added to a rural short age area supports almost 24 J . G . Trogdon, E . A .

In addition, reduced health status related to primar care system shortages reduces labor market productivity and family income, with high levels of both presenteeism and absente eism, and diverts public funds to health care and away from other communal needs, impedes outside investmen t, and reduces savings and capital available for investment. 30 Thus, primary care shortages and the subsequent health impacts have negative impacts o n the entire community, not just those who are ill. IV. What Will t he Future Bring? Inadequate Supply . The information summarized above demonstrate s that the primary care physician workforce is currently inadequate to me et the health care needs of many Tennesseans and that this shortfall can have substantial health and economic consequences. Almost 40 .0 percent than adequate supplies of primary care physicians. Counties with the least adequate supply are those with the greatest potential need they are predominantly rural, have a disproportionately high prevalence of poverty, and have health and socioeconomic measures substantially lower than those of the other counties. Although we focus here on numbers of primary care physicians, other factors are critical to providing optimal primary care. These include the actual use of primary care services by patients, the comprehensiveness and the quality of those services, and the effecti ve 29 F . C . Eilrich, G . A . Doeksen, and C . F .

T he demand for primary care services will grow. Almost 40 million Ame ricans live in areas in which projected primary care needs will exceed 5 .0 percent of current levels. 32 The main drivers of this rising demand include the increasing size and average age of the population, with the attendant increases in the need for prima ry projected to increase by over 12 .0 percent by 2030, and the proportion of Tennesseans 65 years old or older increased by 7.6 percent between 2010 and 2012. 33 Related to these de mographic changes, the burden and costs of chronic diseases amenable to primary care management are projected to rise substantially. The number of cases of diabetes mellitus and hypertension in Tennessee are projected to rise by 45 .0 percent and 35 .0 perc ent , respectively. 34 The expansion of insurance coverage through the A ffordable C are A ct (ACA) , even in states such as Tennessee that have ( so far ) elected not to expand Medicare coverage, will also be significant and will expand access to and increase utiliza tion of primary care services. A s of March 31, 2015, 183,000 Tennesseans h ad enrolled in health plans through the federal H ealth Insurance Exchange , and total monthly enrollment in TennCare and the Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in Tennessee had increased by 17 .0 percent from pre - ACA levels. 35 Although the magnitude of the 31 D .

The date for first - dollar coverage of preventive services wil l also increase the number of primary care visits in Tennessee by over 348,000 per year with a parri passu need for providers. 37 Increasingly Larger Gap. It is also clear that the gap bet ween the supply of and the demand for primary care physicians will continue to increase. National estimates of the need for additional primary care practitioners to provide projected services vary from approximately 12,500 to over 50,000 38 , 39 by 2025. Though the magnitude of these estimates var ies and is subject to many assumptions about future utilization patterns, health care delivery systems, disease trends, development of new treatments and technologies, and public policies , 40 it is generally agreed that many thousands of additional primary care providers will be needed to meet future demand. T he Robert Graham Center reported that to maintain the current rates of service utilization, Tennessee will need an additional 1,107 primary care physicians by 2030, a 27 .0 percent 41 The Center estimate s that 64 .0 percent of the overall increase will result from population growth and 22 .0 percent from increased utilization related to aging; the remaining 13 .0 percent will result fr om expanded insurance coverage. 36 S .

Projections by the Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggest that whereas the primary care physician workforce is expected to increase by 8 .0 percent between 2010 and 2020, the demand for primary care services will increase by 14 .0 percent, with a consequent increase in the supply - demand gap. 42 Between 2001 and 2010, the percent age of all medical residents expecting to enter primary care fell by 6.3 percent despite a 13.6 percent increase in the overall number of resident position s. 43 , 44 When Tennessee faced a similar challenge with the onset of TennCare in the early number of graduates entering primary care training programs. 45 The problem has persisted, and relying principally on increasing the number of practicing primary c are physicians seems an improbable solution, at least in the near future. Suggested Solutions. Thus, under current delivery and education models, Tennessee will likely be unable to provide enough primary care physicians to meet the primary care needs of it s residents in the near future. New and innovative models of health system organization, health care delivery and financing, and health professional training will be needed. Suggestions to ameliorate this problem include, among others : i ncreasing the n umber of primary care physicians through financial and other incentives; increasing the role of nonphysician providers such as advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and clinical p harmacists ; 42 Bureau of Health Professions, Projecting the Supply and Demand for Primary Care Practitioners Through 2020 . 43 M .
