Course Overview : This course is designed to present strategic management from the point of view of the practicing general manager. It focuses on specific knowledge and skills that are required to understand strategy and the process by which it is developed in business orga nizations, and provides information on the situation and context in which strategy is formed and implemented. The course will integrate knowledge and skills developed in the core courses of the B BA program, but that is not its only goal. Specific new information about the activities and skills of general managers will be presented. Students are expected to combine knowledge from other courses with information presented here to develop sophisticated interpretations and analyses of actual business proble ms and opportunities. The course contains a substantial writing component. Students will prepare written business case analyses on both an individual basis and a group basis, and business case presentations on a group basis. The expected level of quality and professionalism of the content and presentation of these cases will be that used in actual business organizations. Much managerial communication is verbal. Therefore, class discussion of lecture and case materials forms a substantial portion of the gr ade for this course. The principal objective of the course is for students to learn important facts and procedures about the strategic management process, while developing an understanding that strategy (and the jobs of those who formulate and implement s trategy) is a highly uncertain activity in which only careful thought, sensitivity to the managerial environment, and creativity will succeed in the long run. Course Learning Objectives: 1. To develop your capacity to think strategically about a company, it s present business position, its long - term direction, its resources and competitive capabilities, the caliber of its strategy, and its opportunities for gaining sustainable competitive advantage. 2. To build your skills in conducting strategic analysis in a variety of industries and competitive situations using relevant strategic analysis tools and concepts. 3. To further your understanding of the challenges of competing in a global market. 4. To acqu aint you with the managerial tasks associated with planning, implementing, and executing company strategies. 5. To integrate the knowledge in earlier core courses in the business school curriculum. 6. To heighten your awareness of why ethical principles an d socially responsible management practices matter 7. To enhance your written and oral business communication skills. Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree This writing - intensive course is d esigned to help you to meet the overall learning goals for the BBA degree offered by the Fogelman College. You should take the time to become familiar with the overall learning goals as a student in the BBA program : earningOutcomes.pdf Grading and Evaluation Criteria Performance evaluation will be based on student performance in six activities: class participation, midterm exam, individual case analysis, team case analysis, team presentation, and homework. Final Course Grades Final course grades are earned according to the following table: Point Range Assigned Grade 94 - 100 Points A 90 - 93 Points A - 87 - 89 Points B + 84 - 86 Points B 80 - 83 Points B - 70 - 79 Points C 60 - 69 Points D Under 60 Points F Performance evaluation will be based on student performance in six activities: class participation, midterm exam, individual case analysis, team case analysis, team presentation, and homework. A detailed description of each of the assessed activities can b e found after the scoring summary table below. Summary of Graded Activities Points earned on the assessed activities will be distributed as follows: Deliverable Total Points Case Participation 4 0 Homework 10 Midterm Examination 10 Individual Case Paper 4 0 Total 100 pts Case Participation 4 0 % of the grade Attendance ( on time ) is required and is a component of the participation grade. In a typical class, one or more students will be asked to start the class by answering a specific question or discussing a specific issue. A thoughtful reading of the chapter or case assigned for that class meeting should be a fuller understanding o f the issues presented. Voluntary participation in discussion of lecture or case issues is an important part of this process and an important part of your class participation grade. Please raise your hand to obtain recognition before speaking. Class partic - class contribution to the discussion. The bases for this assessment include the following: 1. Are the points made relevant to the discussion? Are they linked to the comments of oth ers? 2. Do the comments add to our understanding of the lecture or case discussion? 3. Do the comments show careful reading and understanding of the text and/or case? 4. Does the participant distinguish among different kinds of data (that is facts, opinion s, beliefs, concepts, etc?) 5. ions or comments. Homework 10 % of the grade 20 out of the 2 2 class meetings between August 27 and November 19 (not counting the midterm) . The content of the daily homework assignment will vary depending on the class content for the day it is due. 1. On days when book chapter s are to be discussed, then the assignment is to either (a) include a brief set of two or three original thought - provok ing discussion questions (no more than six sentences total) about each chapter or (b) to provide an example (either positive or negative) of a company and situation currently in the news that illustrates one or more of the concepts in the chapter with a br ief summary of the situation and how the concepts from the chapter are confirmed or denied (include a copy of an article from a business publication if possible). 2. On days when a case is to be discussed, then the assignment is to provide a brief statement ( again, no more than six sentences total) about what you think the company in the case study should do, and why. If you are writing up the case for that day, you should briefly summarize your recommendations. 3. On days when both a case and a chapter are to be discussed, then the assignment is to do both of the above. 4. Homework needs to cover all assignments for that class. Each assignment omitted will reduce the homework grade by one full letter grade. The dropboxes on elearn will close at the beginning of each class . the descriptions above. These assignments should be able to be completed in at most 10 to 15 minutes. Each homework represents ½% of your final grade. If you turn in more than 2 0 homeworks, you will get extra credit (added to your homework grade, not your overall course grade). Midterm Examination 1 0 % of the grade A midterm examination consisting of multiple choice, true/false, and short essay questions will cover the material in the strategy formulation portion of the textbook (Wheelen & Hunger chapters 1 - 8), 4 Arena analysis Hypercompetition, and any related material covered in class . Students are expected to business - level strategies, corporate - level strategies, diversification strategies, and all other relevant material. Individual Case Analysis 4 0 % o f the grade After the third class meeting, you will be expected to choose one case study for your individual case analysis report. A preference sheet for the ca se analysis reports is attached . When the preference sheets have been turned in, I will assign the cases based on your pref erences and distribute copi es . The individual case analysis report constitutes 4 0 % of your overall course grade. This is a very substantial assignment, and will take man y, man y hours of preparation. It cannot be done in one night, or even in one weekend. The individual case analysis report consists of two parts, a strategic audit (attached as an appendix) as described in the textbook and as amended by in - class lectures , and an executive summary. The executive summary should be around seven to ten pages of double - spaced text, with charts and figures included where appropriate. Brevity is important. Your individual case analysis reports are due at the beginning of the class when the case is to be discussed. Be ready to be a major participant in the case discu ssion. You will not be graded separately on the discussion, although it will count as part of your class participation grade. While in - class discussions will be addressing the case as written (as of the time of the case), when you analyze and write up your case you are required to do dynamic case analysis and address the current problems facing the company. See General Requirements for Case Analyses and Dynamic Case Analysis in the next section. General Requirements for Case Analyses Approach the assignmen t as though you are a management consultant hired by the management of the company in the case to solve their problem. First, you must determine what the problem is. Then recommend an action plan for the company to follow. The case analysis report is your You may assume they know the facts of the case, and do not waste their time repeating them. Also, since this report is to executives, be concise. Brevity is important . Get to the point, but be able to support your conclusions with any appropriate analysis. All case analysis reports are due at the beginning of the class when the case is to be discussed. Be prepared to discuss your individual report with the entire class. Do not prepare a formal presentation, but be ready to be a major participant in the case discussion. You will not be graded separately on the discussion, although it will count as part of your class particip ation grade . The following is a suggested format for organizing your case analysis report executive summary. It is up to you to decide on an appropriate format for your specific case and your specific ideas. (1) Brief diagnosis or problem definition (about one paragraph, at most one page). What is t he most important problem or set of problems facing the company? What area(s) is(are) the problem(s) in? Why is it important to solve? (2) Analysis of the problem (about two pages). What caused the problem? What evidence or analysis supports your interpretati on? How does the problem connect with other areas of the company or other businesses? (3) Recommendations (about four pages). What course of action do you suggest? Be specific . How does your solution follow from your problem analysis? How will your plan elimin ate the problem? How will it be implemented? Include an action plan (s ee Table 10 - 1 on p. 253 of the textbook for an example) . How much will your plan cost? Is it feasible? How will it be financed? What are the risks of your plan? What can go wrong? Includ e a risk analysis . How will other actors (competitors, unions, employees, governments, suppliers, etc.) react to your plan? (4) Strategic Audit Appendix (no page limits). A complete strategic audit, as described in the textbook. Include EFAS, IFAS, SFAS, SWOT, and TOWS matrices . How to avoid the most common pitfalls of case analysis: (1) Provide a clear definition of the problem . The case materials will overwhelm you with information. In a Choose the one problem that you think is the most important . Choose your definition of the problem carefully, as the way you define the problem will determine the kinds of solutions you look for. If you define it as a marketing problem, you will seek marketing solutions. If production, production solutions. If finance, finance solutions. And so on. (2) summarize . Do not summarize the facts in the case. Your report is aimed at management, who know the facts. Your report will be graded by someone who knows the facts. Do not rehash facts from the case. You do want to, however, cite facts, information and s tatistics from the case when they are necessary to support your position. But make it clear how they are supporting your position. (3) Always perform financial analyses . sure unless you do the analyses. See Chapter 15 in Hunger & Wheelen (especially pp. 357 - 35 8 ) for some of the kinds of analyses that are appropriate. (4) Support your analysis, ideas, and recommendations with adequate evidence . Again, cite facts, information and statistics from the c ase to justify your analysis. (5) Make sure your recommendations address the problem you defined . Do not define one problem, then by the end of the analysis be recommending solutions to a different problem. (6) Give practical, specific, feasible action recommendat ions . Make your recommendations the central focus of your paper. (7) Consider the risks . No plan is foolproof. Anticipate and prepare for risks. (8) . support your recom mendation. But see numbers (2), (3), and (4). (9) - washy . Yes, there may be multiple alternatives. Yes, you may mention them. But choose one best alternative. Dynamic Case Analysis Traditional case analysis, in which the reader is presented with all the information needed to develop a managerial context for strategic analysis, is an inadequate approach for conveying the managerial problems faced in environments in which technology and/or competition are moving a rapid pace a situation characterizing more and more industries. In these environments, a sense of the pace and nature of change is required, and current (or near - current) information is desirable if the strategic analysis is to have any relev ance to the real world. Thus, in this course, even though most of the selected cases were written as of 2005 to 2012, the written case will be merely the starting point for setting the context. In preparing a dynamic case, the first step for the reader is to thoroughly read and understand the issues in the case material in the book including the industry analysis segment (if any). The reader should then use the case as a guide to generate an upda - line and CD - ROM data bases available in the library, as well as reviewing the current trade literature. Topics for updating would include technology developments, the current state of the economy -- in general as well as in the target segment, a current status outline of the firm in question, changes in management or other key players, new product characteristics (including pricing), recent developments in competition, the status of the supplier and customer segme nt of the target segment, developments in government regulation, as well as forecasts in each of the foregoing areas. Key strategic events and issues should be identified in the update material and put into a summary form for discussion in class. Special a ttention should be paid to characterizing the nature and pace of technological and competitive change. Two of the characteristics that distinguish high technology environments from low technology environments are the pace and rhythm of change in the underl ying technology and the pace and rhythm of competitive actions in bringing that technology to market, so these elements should clearly appear in a case update. Graphs, charts, summary statistics and diagrams that compress the data into readily comprehensib le material are especially suitable for a case update. General Rules Regarding Written Work: 1.) Use a spelling checker . 2.) Minimal grammatical errors . These rules are firm because they replicate the conditions the student should expect to find in any w ell - run business establishment. In general, professionally managed enterprises do not commit, nor accept, needless reputation for accuracy and atte ntion to detail, and take attention away from the content of the message presented. Course Policies Online Components (eLearn): The course has a web site at where I will be posting copies of all materials, including lecture slideshows (the day after the lecture). There are also dropboxes there where you must turn in assignments. Written work is due at the beginning of class on the day it is due, and that is w hen the dropboxes close. Late papers should be submitted to the late dropboxes and will be assessed up to a 30 point (3 letter grades) penalty. E - MAIL: All students are required to maintain and access their University of Memphis (@memphis.edu) email accou nt. You will receive all official course correspondence at this email account. Any inability to receive incoming Attendance: Class attendance (on time) is required at every class meeting. More than two absences will result in a deduction to the case participation grade of the student. If a student does miss a class, it is his or her responsibility to find out from classmates what materials were covered, what additional assignments were made, and what items may have been distributed in class . Class will begin on time . You are expected to be in your seat and ready to begin the leadoff discussion at that time. Learn to be prompt. Showing up late to meetings shows a lack of respect, and will not help your career. Start getting used to it now, when all it can hurt is your grade. Adding / Dropping: If you have questions about adding or dropping classes, please refer to this page on the . Academic Integrity: The University of Memphis has clear codes regarding cheating and classroom misconduct. If interested, you may refer to the Student Handbook section on academic misconduct for a discussion of these codes. Note that Office of Student Conduct website . If you have any questions about academic integrity or plagiarism, you are strongly encouraged to review the Fogelman College's Website on Academic Integrity . Study groups are acceptable for all assignments except the individual case analysis. The individual case analysis must be solely your own work and no discussion with other persons or collaboration of any kind is allowed on this assignment. Receiving any assistance on this assignment is a violation of the University of Memphis Code of Stude nt Conduct and will result in a zero grade on the assignment, which, as it represents 40% of the overall grade, will result in a failing grade for the course. Participation: As described above under Case Participation, participation in case discussions is a part of your final grade. I will be fully prepared for every class and expect you to be the same. I sometimes call on students whose hands are not raised, and therefore request that you advise me before class if some emergency has made it impossible for you to prepare adequately for class discussion . As described above under Attendance, missing classes can negatively affect your participation grade, as can tardiness. Class will begin on time. You are expected to be in your seat and ready to begin the le adoff discussion at that time. Learn to be prompt. Showing up late to meetings shows a lack of respect, and will not help your career. Start getting used to it now, when all it can hurt is your grade. I will attempt to learn your names as quickly as possi ble. However, to allow me to keep track of participation grades from the very beginning, I will be using a seating chart. Please sit in your assigned seats. If you do not, you will be marked absent. Classroom Behavior: All participants in the course shoul d be considerate of the other course participants and treat them (as well as their opinions) with respect. The class will operate under the assumption that any and all feedback offered is positive in nature and that the intentions of the person(s) providin g feedback are strictly honorable. Insensitivity in this area will not be tolerated. Disruptive behavior (including but not limited to coming in late, leaving during class, phone alerts or ringing, as well as audible side conversations) will result in a d eduction to the case participation grade. No recording devices are permitted in class. Please do not eat during class. Hats and caps should not be worn in class. Notebook computers and handhelds can only be used for taking notes. Any other uses (checking email, messaging, searching the web, etc.), or any use of a cellphone, will cause you to get a zero participation grade for that class and therefore count as an ab sence. Late Assignments: Assignments and projects may be submitted anytime up to and including the date and time due as indicated on the corresponding dropbox on eLearn time, it must be placed in the appropriate late dropbox, and the instructor wil l deduct up to 30 points (3 letter grades) depending upon the circumstances and appropriate communication between the student and the instructor. Extra Credit: As described under the Homework assignment section, extra credit is offered for additional homew ork beyond the required number, however this extra credit only affects the homework portion of your final grade (although it does make it possible to get a perfect score on homework). Reporting Illness or Absence: Due dates and deadlines have been establi shed for each graded assignment. In this course, deadlines are taken very seriously, just as they will be in the professional world. Please do not wait until the last day to submit ity to contact the instructor prior to the deadline to discuss the matter. A deadline extension will be considered only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) Extreme emergency and (2) Instructor contacted prior to the due date . Inclement Weather: In the event that inclement weather requires the cancellation of classes at The University of Memphis, local radio and television media will be immediately notified. Additionally, The University of Memphis has established an Inclement Weather Hot line at 678 - 0888 as well as TigerText , an emergency alert text messaging service to students, faculty and staff. This optional service is used in the event of an on - campus emergency, an unschedul ed university closing, or a delay or cancellation of classes due to, for instance, inclement weather. Click Here for information on TigerText. Syllabus Changes: The instructor reserves the right to make changes as necessary to this syllabus. If changes are necessitated during the term of the course, the instructor will immediately notify students of such changes both by individual email communication and posting both notification and nature of cha nge(s) on eLearn.
