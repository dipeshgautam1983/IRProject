Mechanical Engineering Programs Students Faculty Research Alumni News Accreditation Program Undergraduate Program Graduate Program ME Degrees Offered Home ME Program BSME Program Description and Degree Requirement Department of Mechanical Engineering Mechanical Engineering is a broad field that contains many areas. Students are offered a wide variety of topics that touch on as many of these areas as possible in a balanced four-year program. The curriculum is designed to prepare graduates for professional practice, and to provide a foundation for lifelong learning as well as professional growth. The course of study begins with a strong foundation in mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering sciences, and culminates in a series of synthesis and design courses. These require the student to apply material learned in foundation courses to practical design problems in various areas. Traditional classroom instruction is supplemented with laboratory experiences in four areas. The laboratory courses are designed to develop the student’s knowledge base with a hands-on learning experience. The program educational objectives express expectations of the program graduates' abilities within the first few years after successfully completing this comprehensive curriculum. (1) Graduates are employed as mechanical engineers or in other professional fields that would benefit from a Mechnical Engineering education. (2) Graduates pursue advanced studies or engage in life-long learning activities. The diversity encountered in the profession requires the successful Mechanical Engineer to have technical and non-technical skills. Courses in the humanities and social sciences enhance non-technical skills, and explore the engineer’s relationship with, and responsibility to, society. Students learn that as professionals, they identify with other engineers, and that the welfare of the public is of prime concern. These non-technical courses allow the student to interact and communicate effectively with a wide variety of individuals. While students are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination, prior to graduation, students are required to take and pass a Simulated Fundamentals of Engineering examination, which is administered as a component of MECH 4300. ADMISSION: Admission to the university will allow a student to be in a pre-mechanical engineering major. Movement into the major requires: 1) a cumulative GPA of 2.25 for all university level courses completed, 2) a grade of at least a "C-" for each of the following 5 courses (or equivalents), and 3) a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 for these 6 courses. MATH 1910 Calculus I CHEM 1110 General Chemistry I PHYS 2110 Science/Engineering Physics I MECH 1310 Introduction to Mechanical Engineering MECH 1312 Mechanical Engineering Computing I MECH 1314 Mechanical Engineering Computing II Pre-mechanical engineering majors may not register for MECH courses at or above the 3000-level. Exceptions to these criteria are at the discretion of the department chair or the undergraduate program coordinator. Graduation: To earn a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree, the student must satisfy University and College requirements, and obtain a minimum 2.0 grade point average on all work completed, and obtain a minimum grade of "C-" in all engineering, mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses used to satisfy degree requirements. Accelerated B.S.M.E./M.S. Program in Mechanical Engineering This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.S.M.E./M.S. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.S.M.E. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.S. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Mechanical Engineering department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in mechanical engineering. Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.S.M.E./M.S. program, which allows them to take graduate courses in mechanical engineering. To continue in the program past the B.S.M.E., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the Mechanical Engineering department's M.S. program. Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply to undergraduate GPA. Mechanical Engineering (B.S.M.E.) A. University General Education Program (36 hours) See Graduation from the University for University General Education Program requirements.
