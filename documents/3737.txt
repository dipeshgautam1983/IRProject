Graduate Catalog Home About Admissions Academic Regulations Faculty and Staff Archive Home Graduate Catalog Academic Regulations Credit by Exam Credit by Exam In cases where the student has knowledge, but has not taken the appropriate course, the academic units, with approval from the Dean of the Graduate School or designee, may offer graduate courses for credit by examination. Total credit-by-examination applied to a student's degree program may not exceed nine (9) semester hours. The necessary form is available on the Graduate School web site. The following regulations govern the granting of credit by examination: A student enrolled in a degree program (full-time or part-time) who is in good academic standing may make application to take an examination for credit. The student must follow these steps to obtain credit by examination: Fill out the top of the form and obtain the signatures of the major advisor, department chair, and college director of graduate studies. Pay the fee and attach the receipt to the form. Take the form to the department chair, who will sign it after the exam has been taken and a satisfactory grade earned. When the department chair returns the completed form to the Graduate School, the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies or designee will authorize the posting of the credit to the student's record. The form of the examination, the method of administering it, and the time of examination are left to the discretion of colleges and academic units. To receive credit, the student's examination grade should be equivalent to at least a "B" (3.0). Credit is indicated on the student's record as "S" but is not figured in the GPA. The only remedy to an unsuccessful credit-by-examination grade is to enroll in and complete the course. Maximum Combined Credit Hours to Fulfill Degree Requirements For Master's students, the maximum amount of combined hours of transfer credit, credit by examination, course validation and experiential learning credit that can be used to fulfill degree requirements is two-thirds the number of hours required for the degree. For doctoral students, the maximum amount of combined hours of transfer credit, credit-by-examination, course validation and experiential learning credit that can be used to fulfill degree requirements two-thirds the number of hours required for the degree. The Graduate School sets minimum standards to which all the diverse graduate programs across the university must adhere. Individual colleges, schools, and graduate programs are encouraged to set more stringent requirements as necessary to meet their accreditation and student needs. For additional information about credit by examination procedures, contact the Graduate School Graduation Analyst, Michelle Stout , or the Graduate School Office at 901.678.4212.
