Pay WHEN: Hourly employees are paid on a biweekly basis. The paycheck is received every other Friday. Monthly employees are paid once a month; on the last working day of the month. Payroll Schedules Nine-month faculty are appointed August through May. The annual salary is divided among 12 months (September through August). HOW: All payrolls are direct deposited into up to two accounts at any financial institution that is a member of Automated Clearing House (ACH). The first direct deposit to your account will usually be the second payroll after the Payroll Office has entered your authorization. If you make a change to your direct deposit, your next check will be manual and will need to be picked up at the Bursar's cashier windows (located in 115 Wilder Tower) with picture identification.
