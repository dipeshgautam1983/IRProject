They mean you are an ethical individual who can provide an independent viewpoint. Preparing for the Exam TTo become a CPA in Tennessee, candidates must obtain 150 semester hours of education and must earn a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. This must include 30 semester hours in accounting (24 of which must be in upper division courses) and 24 semester hours in business courses (12 of which must be in upper division courses). The candidate must then pass the Uniform CPA Examination, pass an ethics examination given by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) with a score of 90% or better, and complete one year of experience in accounting acceptable to the Board. Our Master of Science in Accounting program includes the opportunity to take 6 credit hours of CPA Exam Preparation (ACCT 7626 and ACCT 7627) in concert with the Becker CPA Review. For information on these courses contact Dr. Charlene Spiceland .
