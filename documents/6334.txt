In 2015, the College enrolled more than 2,500 undergraduate and graduate students in nationally-accredited professional programs. Over forty degree programs that prepare students for varied career paths are offered through the three departments within the College of Education. We take pride in being home to multiple research centers and institutes that are as diverse in their focus as are the faculty and departments in the College and in building partnerships with the dynamic communities that we serve. The College is also home to the Barbara K. Lipman Early Childhood School and Research Institute and the Campus Elementary School, which are among fewer than 100 university and college laboratory schools in the U.S. The College takes pride in demonstrating best practices for students preparing to be leaders in education.
