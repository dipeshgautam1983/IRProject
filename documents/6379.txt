Website About Professor Anderson Professor Anderson (PhD, Rutgers University) joined the faculty in 2012. Before coming to Memphis, he was Alain Locke Postdoctoral Fellow at Pennsylvania State University. His research lies principally in Philosophy of Language, Philosophy of Race, and Aesthetics. More specifically, he works on Black semantics and racial language. His current project, a book manuscript tentatively titled Racial Semantics, examines the relationship between race, power, and linguistic practice. I argue that grammaticality, judgments of "legitimate speech," and overtly racist speech function as ways of masking the racially oppressive mechanisms of ordinary linguistic practice. I examine the possibility of subversive speech within this racially oppressive linguistic framework. Luvell's work in aesthetics focuses on racist humor and the normativity of offense. He also has interests in social and political philosophy and the philosophy of mind.
