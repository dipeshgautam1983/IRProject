About Checklist About Checklist A checklist is a way to highlight important or required assignments, readings, or other items to complete. A checklist may list all the items you need to complete at once or may have items appear as you complete other items. Each checklist contains one or more categories, in which checklist items are organized. For example, you might have an “Assignments” checklist with categories for written assignments and quizzes, both of which could have multiple items that you need to complete.
