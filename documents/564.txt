Degree Program 12:07:48 PM]USING THE CATALOG FOR DEGREE PROGRAM PLANNINGEach student is responsible for fulfilling all of the requirements for the degree program being pursued and for following the procedures and regulations as stated in the Catalog in effect when entering college. The Catalog is valid for seven years. Students should keep a copy of the Catalog they enter under until they graduate. Assistance from an advisor is helpful in planning the program of studies and in selecting the specific courses to be taken for each semester. The Graduation from the University section of the Catalog outlines the minimum university level degreerequirements. Some colleges specify the exact manner in which the university level requirements must be met. In addition to these, the student must fulfill the college level requirements for the degree and the major requirements. If the admission and/or retention standards for a particular college or department differ from the university requirements, they will be listed in the college degree program description. If they do not, the university requirements apply. The guidelines below will be helpful in planning which program to follow.1. Read the Catalog to investigate what options are available; 2. consult with an academic advisor in the Academic Counseling Unit and/or the colleges which offer majors which are of interest to you; 3. talk with the departmental faculty in these areas of interest; 4. take advantage of the counseling offerings of the Center for Student Development (Testing, Career Counseling, Academic Counseling, Personal/Psychological Counseling, and the Educational Support Program);5. become familiar with the Academic Regulations section of the Catalog; determine the grades which are needed to insure retention and graduation as well as honors classifications in the university and in individual programs; 6. if you are undecided about a major area, begin your program of studies with those courses required for all degrees. After a major has been chosen: 1. Consult with your advisor to determine what procedures are necessary to declare a major; 2. read the entire section of the Catalog which relates to the degree and major selected: note all degree requirements listed for the college such as the number of hours required within the college and outside the college and the number of upper division hours required; list all the general education courses required for the college or obtain a degree sheet from the college advisor; note the major requirements (when choices are allowed, be sure to consult with your major advisor); 3. plan your coursework semester by semester; try to complete all of your lower division courses (1000- 2000) during your first two years; be sure to check for prerequisites before enrolling in any courses, especially upper division courses; take the courses in the proper sequence. To complete a 132 semester hour degree program in four years, you need to take 33 hours per year. The maximum allowed per semester (fall/spring) is 18 hours. Special permission must be received in order to carry more than 18 hours. Physical activity courses are not included in the 18-hour maximum. Description of the 12:07:49 PM]DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIVERSITY GENERAL DESCRIPTION THE MEMPHIS COMMUNITY ACADEMIC PROGRAM ACCREDITATION FACILITIES, RESEARCH AND SERVICES THE GRADUATE SCHOOL CECIL C. HUMPHREYS SCHOOL OF LAW THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS STATEMENT OF MISSION The University of Memphis is a member of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee and is governed by the Tennessee Board of Regents. As an urban university, The University of Memphis provides a stimulating academic environment for its students, including an innovative undergraduate education and excellence in selected research areas and graduate programs. The academic environment extends beyond the campus boundaries to encompass the entire community. Education is enhanced through exposure to diversity in composition of the student body, faculty, staff, and administrators; including women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and various age groups and religions. The University has responded to the challenging responsibility of being located in a culturally diverse region by developing a unique blend of teaching, research, and service that contributes to the growth of the Mid-South region. Teaching brings the benefits of scholarship and research to students and through them to the people of the area. The University of Memphis asserts that excellence in teaching traditional and non-traditional students is its central responsibility. A comprehensive undergraduate education, grounded in the arts and sciences, develops intellectual, cultural, and ethical qualities in its students. The innovative General Education Program challenges students to develop the analytical and critical skills necessary for life-long learning. The University of Memphis offers master's and doctoral degrees in selected graduate programs as well as degrees in the major professional areas. Through learning begun at the University of Memphis, graduates compete in the global intellectual community in which they live. As a research university, The University of Memphis develops, integrates, disseminates, and applies knowledge. Faculty maintain on-going programs of basic and applied research or creative activities appropriate to their disciplines. The University's urban environment provides a rich opportunity for research and creative scholarship, and for the use of that scholarship in the intellectual and cultural development of the region. The University's commitment to fostering a research and creative environment harmonizes with the other aspects of its mission. The University of Memphis fulfills its outreach mission through its contributions to professional organizations and to the needs of the community. The University promotes intellectual, cultural, and community development of the region through, for example, its artistic programs, lecture series, technical assistance, continuing education, and intercollegiate athletic programs. The University of Memphis, through its research, teaching, and outreach roles, responds to individual needs, such as the support of health care and preventive health services. The University addresses broader issues as well, for instance, K-12 education, economic development, environmental initiatives, international programs, computing, and telecommunications. GENERAL DESCRIPTION Description of the University From the opening of its doors in 1912 as a normal school for training teachers to its present status as one of Tennessee's two comprehensive universities, The University of Memphis has been thrust forward by the Description of the 12:07:49 PM]growth of Memphis and the Mid-South. A town oriented to a rural economy and culture in 1900 grew into a large urban and commercial center mid-century, and the city's public institution of higher learning experienced comparable growth. The metropolitan and regional requirements for more highly trained university graduates have, of necessity, caused the university to expand all its offerings in arts and sciences, business, the fine arts, education, engineering and technology, law, and several special professional fields. Degrees range from the baccalaureate through the doctorate. Approximately 80 percent of the full-time faculty have earned the highest possible degree in their fields. The university strives to optimize its resources in its quest for excellence through teaching, research and service. With an enrollment of almost 20,000, The University of Memphis is committed to developing programs of the highest caliber, for only through such a commitment will it be a standard of quality in higher education for the citizens of our service area. As the comprehensive university of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee, The University of Memphis is striving to increase the ratio of doctoral programs it offers, which will also require an increased emphasis on research and scholarship activity. The university is committed to serving a diverse student body of all races, sexes and nationalities. Our students are expected, upon graduation, to be able to compete effectively with their counterparts from any other respected university in the nation. HistoryThe roots of The University of Memphis date back to September 12, 1912, with the establishment and beginning of classes at West Tennessee State Normal School, which provided for the training of primary and secondary education teachers. However, the seeds for the normal school's creation were sown three years earlier, in 1909, when the Tennessee General Assembly passed a General Education law calling for establishment and maintenance of three normal schools, one school located in each of the three grand divisions of the state. The eastern edge of Memphis became the site for West Tennessee State Normal School, which in 1929 became West Tennessee State Teachers College. In 1941, the college expanded its liberal arts curriculum, and the name was changed to Memphis State College--an institution serving three to four thousand students. The undergraduate program was reorganized into three schools and a graduate school was added in 1951. Memphis State achieved university status in 1957, and on July 1, 1994, the name was officially changed to The University of Memphis. Governing Body The governance and control of The University of Memphis is vested in the Tennessee Board of Regents. The Board of Regents consists of 18 members including 13 appointed by the Governor; four ex officio members- -the Governor, Commissioner of Education, Commissioner of Agriculture, and the Executive Director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission--and one statutory member. One member is appointed from each of the state's nine congressional districts, and three are approved at-large from different geographical areas of the state. A student regent is appointed from one of the system institutions for a one-year term. OrganizationThe schools and colleges that make up the university are the Graduate School, the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, the University College, the Loewenberg School of Nursing, the School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, and five colleges offering graduate and undergraduate programs: the College of Arts and Sciences, the Fogelman College of Business and Economics, the College of Communication and Fine Arts, the College of Education, and the Herff College of Engineering. The institution also offers a University Honors Program for highly motivated students seeking exceptional and challenging programs of study in a variety of disciplines. The colleges, departments, and the undergraduate degree programs they offer are described in more detail in the Colleges and Degree Programs section of this catalog. Description of the 12:07:49 PM]THE MEMPHIS COMMUNITY Memphis, with a metropolitan area population of just over one million, is one of the South's largest and most attractive cities. As a primary medical, educational, communication, distribution and transportation center, Memphis offers a rich and full range of research opportunities and cultural experiences.

This arrangement is available Description of the 12:07:49 PM]only for students whose home states do not offer the designated program. The state in which the student resides determines which of the programs offered by The University of Memphis it will make available to its students.The Academic Common Market is sponsored by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB). Participating states are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia (Florida and Texas grant access for graduate level programs only). Students may request through their home state coordinators that additional programs be made accessible. A list of the state coordinators with their addresses and telephone numbers may be obtained from the Office of Curriculum Planning. (Graduate students should contact the Graduate Admissions Office.) In addition to certification requirements which the student's state of residence may specify, the following pertain: (1) Students must be fully admitted to a degree program that has been approved as an Academic Common Market program (non-degree students are ineligible); (2) students must obtain a letter certifying residency and approval for the particular University of Memphis program from their state's Academic Common Market coordinator. NOTE: After enrollment, students remain eligible for in-state tuition only so long as they are continuously enrolled_consecutive fall and spring terms_in the major for which they were originally certified. If students change major, they must process a Change of Major through their advisor and notify the Applicant Services Office to change the Academic Common Market residency code on their records. Failure to process the Change of Major and to notify applicant services may subject the student to out-of-state fees for all subsequent terms of enrollment in classes for a major other than the one for which the student received ACM certification. Missing a fall or spring term of enrollment requires that the student be recertified through the ACM coordinator in the student's state of residence.

Undergraduate programs with special admission requirements include, but are not limited to, professional degrees in art, music, or theatre (Bachelor of Fine Arts or Bachelor of Music), teacher education, educational services, nursing, and the University College. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. Early admission contributes to better orientation, course planning, class scheduling and financial aid consideration. High school students planning to apply as freshmen should submit applications as soon as possible after completion of the junior year. Applications for admission are available from many secondary school/guidance counseling offices and from the Office of Admissions, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152. All credentials become the property of the university and cannot be forwarded or returned. Credentials will be maintained in active files for a 12--month period. After this period, credentials will be relegated to inactive status and must be submitted again before an admission decision can be made. Regulations in this section are subject to change without notice. ADMISSION AS DEGREE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES Services to 12:07:50 PM]The deadlines for submitting applications for admission are: August 1 for the fall semester, December 1 for the spring semester, and May 1 for the summer session. Applications received after these deadlines may be delayed in processing or processed at the non-degree level. Freshman Applicants An applicant who has no previous college enrollment may be considered for admission as a regular undergraduate freshman by submitting the following to the Admissions Office: 1. A final transcript of all high school credits: Early decisions can be made by submitting partial transcripts (6th or 7th semester). Transcripts carried by the student are not acceptable for the admissions file. If any courses have been taken for college credit, the institution(s) granting credit must be contacted and asked to send an official transcript to The University of Memphis, Office of Admissions. Graduates of an unapproved or non-accredited high school must take the General Educational Development (GED) test and earn an average standard score of at least 45. This GED requirement is waived for students who earn the minimum ACT required for guaranteed admission. However, the GED may be advisable for students who graduated in 1989 or thereafter from an unapproved or non-approved high school and are deficient in one or more of the required high school courses. Students who have achieved a high school diploma through the General Education Development (GED) Test must also have the GED scores sent to the Office of Admissions. Students who do not present one unit of American History are required to register for the course during their first or second year at the university. 2. The score report of the American College Testing program (ACT) or the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT): The score report is a necessary part of the application and the test date should be no more than three years old at the time of enrollment. Applicants who are offered admission with the enhanced ACT composite, English or math subscores less that 19, or the equivalent on the former ACT, will be required to take a placement examination prior to enrollment. Based on the results of the assessment, these applicants may be required to successfully complete remedial and/or developmental courses prior to enrolling in degree credit courses.

Applicants with special talents or circumstances who do not meet requirements for guaranteed admission may be considered. For further information contact the Office of Admissions. Applicants with diagnosed learning disabilities should contact the Director of the Office for Students with Disabilities for further information. High School Curriculum Required For Admission No high school curriculum can assure that a given student will acquire desired learning outcomes; however, the absence of certain components greatly increases the likelihood that the student will not acquire those outcomes and reduces the likelihood that the student will enjoy maximum benefits of a college experience. The justification for colleges' recommending or requiring specific high school units for admission is to reduce the likelihood that a student will be unprepared for effective work in college and to increase maximum benefits a student may enjoy. Effective the Fall Semester 1989, among the units required for graduation, the following specific high school units must be included in the minimum admissions requirements at all Tennessee State Board of Regents universities and colleges. Students who do not take one or more of these required courses, where they are available, Services to 12:07:50 PM]may not be eligible for admission to the university. ENGLISH (4 units required): Units in this category must address reading and literature, writing, speaking and listening, and principles concerning the English language. Extensive experience in reading and writing should characterize all courses. VISUAL AND/OR PERFORMING ARTS (l unit required): Units in this category should include a survey of the arts (visual arts, theater, music, and dance) or active participation in one or more of the arts. MATHEMATICS (3 units required): Units in this category must include Algebra I, Algebra II, and geometry or an advanced course with geometry as a major component. Students are recommended to take a fourth unit in computing, advanced mathematics, or statistics. All college freshmen will benefit by having studied mathematics as seniors. NATURAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES (2 units required): Units in this category must include mathematical skills, fundamental concepts, and some laboratory and field work. At least one unit must address detailed knowledge in the more traditional fields of biology, chemistry, or physics and must include a laboratory. SOCIAL STUDIES (2 units required): For students graduating prior to spring 1993, the units in this category may include: history, government, geography, economics, sociology, psychology, or anthropology. For students graduating in the spring 1993 or thereafter, these units must come from the following: modern history, ancient history, world history, world geography, or European history. One unit in American History is also required. FOREIGN LANGUAGE (2 units required): Two units in a single foreign language are required in this category. These stipulated high school units are not intended to specify what the total high school curriculum should be. Secondary schools seek to meet the needs of various student clienteles, one of which is the college- bound student. The stipulations are, on the other hand, an attempt to make a strategic application of academic competencies. They reflect the bridge from specific desired learning outcomes to a list of required college admission criteria. That list is composed of high school units presumed most likely to result in the required learning outcomes. For the sake of clarity, one unit constitutes one year of high school study of a given subject. Applicants with subject deficiencies may, with proper institutional approvals, be admitted to the university; however, the deficiencies must be removed during the first 64 semester hours (30 semester hours for transfer students) of college enrollment. College level courses taken to remove unit deficiencies must be completed with a grade of C or better and will be used for elective credit only. Different requirements may be specified for certain groups of applicants: adult students (i.e., students separated from high school graduation by three or more years), GED students who are not high school graduates, and international students. Transfer and re-entry students may be required to remove any deficiencies before regular admission.OUT-OF-STATE APPLICANTS Acceptance to the university for out-of-state applicants who meet guaranteed admission standards may be granted on the same basis as for in-state applicants. Acceptance for all other out-of-state applicants is competitive.Out of state applicants who qualify for and participate in the University Honors Program may qualify for a waiver of the out-of-state tuition differential. EARLY ADMISSION APPLICANTS Academically outstanding high school juniors who have completed three academic years of high school, accumulating at least 14 units of course work may be considered for early admission if they have the following:1. A minimum high school cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 on a 4.00 scale. 2. A minimum ACT composite score of 26 on the enhanced ACT or the equivalent on the former ACT. Services to 12:07:50 PM]3. Written recommendations from high school principal and guidance counselor. 4. An interview with U of M faculty/staff committee selecting early admission students. In addition, they must agree to enroll in freshman English, and, unless successfully completed in high school, courses in American history and economics. NOTE: Early admission applicants should also check with their high school for specific graduation requirements.Transfer Applicants The University of Memphis welcomes applications from students who have begun college elsewhere. They may transfer to The University of Memphis with any number of units. If they have fifteen (15) or more semester units transferable from a fully accredited college or university, students are evaluated primarily on college-level work. If they have fewer than fifteen (15) transferable units, students are evaluated on a combination of college-level and high school course work, and college entrance examination results. To qualify for degree-seeking transfer admission, the applicant must request that a transcript from each institution attended be sent directly to the Office of Admissions. Transfer applicants who graduated from high school in 1989 or later may also be subject to the high school curriculum requirements found above in this section of the catalog. To make this determination, a high school transcript is necessary. Therefore, all transfer applicants whose high school graduation date was in 1989 or later should have a transcript mailed directly from their high school to the Admissions Office.

OTHER REGISTRATION (ENROLLMENT) FEE INFORMATION RESIDENCY CLASSIFICATION: All determinations concerning the classification of students as in state or out of state for fee purposes are made in the Office of Admissions. The determinations are based on the regulations and guidelines of the Tennessee Board of Regents. If, for any reason, there is a question about a student's residency classification for fee payment purposes, the student is responsible for requesting a review of their residency status before classes begin. ACADEMIC COMMON MARKET: Participation in the Academic Common Market allows qualified students from southern states to pay in-state tuition while pursuing certain degree programs at The University of Memphis. This arrangement is available only for students whose home states do not offer the designated program. The state in which the student resides determines which of the programs offered by The University of Memphis the home state will make available to its students. The Academic common Market is sponsored by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB). Participating states are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia (Florida and Texas grant access for graduate level programs only). Current SREB common market guidelines and requirements may be found on the web at: Students may request through their home state coordinators that additional programs be made accessible. A list of the state coordinators with their addresses and telephone numbers may be obtained from the Office of Curriculum Planning (Graduate students should contact the Graduate Admissions Office.) In addition to certification requirements which the student's state of residence may specify, the following pertain: (1) Students must be fully admitted to a degree program that has been approved as an Academic Common Market program (non-degree students are ineligible); (2) students must obtain a letter certifying residency term of entry and approval for the particular University of Memphis program from their state's Academic Common Market coordinator. NOTE: After enrollment, students remain eligible for in-state tuition only so long as they are continuously enrolled-consecutive fall and spring terms- in the same major for which they were originally certified. If students change major, they must process a Change of Major through their advisor and notify the Applicant Services Office to change the Academic Common Market residency code on their records. Failure to process the Change of Major and to notify applicant services may subject the student to out-of state fees for all subsequent terms of enrollment in classes for a major other than the one for 12:07:52 PM]which the student received ACM certification. Missing a fall or spring term of enrollment or a change of major requires that the student be recertified through the ACM coordinator in the student's state or residence.FEES FOR TOTALLY DISABLED PERSONS AND PERSONS OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE: Persons who are domiciled in Tennessee and (1) have a permanent disability that totally incapacitates them from the potential to work at an occupation that brings them an income, or (2) who will become 60 years of age or older during the academic semester in which they begin classes, may AUDIT courses at The University of Memphis without paying tuition charges, maintenance fees, student activity fees, access fees, or registration fees. Admission to AUDIT will be limited on an individual classroom basis according to space availability. Those who are totally disabled and those who will become 65 years of age or older during the academic semester in which they begin classes, and who are domiciled in Tennessee, may enroll for courses for credit at the cost of $46.00 per undergraduate semester hour, or $63.50 per graduate semester hour, not to exceed $75.00 per semester. University Health Services shall examine certification of permanent disability (not the applicant) and determine the eligibility of the applicant under this legislation. Inquiries concerning these programs may be addressed to the Registration and Scheduling Office, Room 167, Administration Building.

This decision may be appealed to the University Fee/Refund Appeals Committee. The recommendation of the committee will be forwarded to the Vice President for Business and Finance for a final decision, which will conclude the University's appeal process. The listing of any fee or incidental charge in this publication does not constitute a contract between the university and the student. As a condition of registration, each student will pay the fees in effect for the semester for which he or she registers. All questions in regard to fees, fee payment, refunds, and appeals should be directed to the Bursar's Office, Room 176 Administration Building. Fees are subject to change without notice. The university will usually collect the amount of fees due at the time of registration and during the adding and dropping of classes in accordance with the residency classification and fee rates in effect. After all enrollments are complete, any over-collections will be refunded and students will be billed for any under-collections. Fees for AUDITING courses are assessed on the same basis as fees for credit courses. Courses offered between terms, for concentrated periods during a term, or at specific locations may be subject to fees on a per-hour basis only. UNIVERSITY ID CARDS The University of Memphis issues each student an identification card that bears the student's image and 12:07:52 PM]social security number. All students should obtain this permanent identification card that is used as the primary campus-wide method of determining privileges and accesses permitted each student. The ID card is required for the borrowing of library books, admission to or approval to pick up or purchase student tickets to athletic and social events, the sale of used text books, and other official purposes. There is no charge to the student for the initial university ID card and it is automatically validated each semester the student enrolls and satisfies registration fees. The card remains the property of The University of Memphis and should be surrendered upon the request of any university official. Each student may possess only ONE university ID card at any time. Students may obtain a replacement for a lost, stolen, or damaged university ID card from the ID Card Office in Room 171 of the Administration Building, between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday and 7:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Friday.

Academic 12:07:53 PM]ACADEMIC REGULATIONS APPEALSCLASS ATTENDANCE CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS SCHOLASTIC STANDARDS ADDITIONAL MEANS OF EARNING CREDIT APPEALSStudents have the right to appeal decisions made by university officials in the implementation of university policy. If a student feels that individual circumstances warrant an appeal, the request for appeal must be filed in the university office responsible for the implementation of that policy or the office specified in the policy statement. CLASS ATTENDANCE Class attendance may be used in computing grades at the discretion of the instructor. If attendance is to be used, a complete written statement of the instructor's policy detailing the weight of attendance in determining the final grade must be presented to all students present at the first and second meetings of the class. A student who is absent from the final examination without the permission of the teacher incurs a grade of F on the examination and may, depending on the weight of the examination in determining the final grade, incur a grade of F for the course. Students who receive VA benefits or Title IV funds for enrollment fees are subject to cancellation of future awards and immediate repayment of these benefits if they stop attending whether or not they officially withdraw or drop a course. The last known date of attendance will be reported by the instructor as the "unofficial withdrawal date". Students who stop attending will be assigned a grade of "F" in courses which do not reflect an official withdrawal. Adding and Dropping Courses After the official registration period is over, students may make adjustments in their schedules through the process of adding and/or dropping courses. (For dates and times, see the Schedule of Classes. See also The University of Memphis homepage on the web at ) Courses dropped through the last day of the Late Registration period will not be shown on the student's permanent record. Courses dropped after the Late Registration period will be indicated on the record as withdrawal grades for those courses. A student may drop any course or courses up through the date specified in the University Calendar for that term. (The University Calendar is located in the front of this Catalog.) Requests for exceptions must be made within the next regular term following the term in which the grade was assigned. Exceptions are made only by the dean in the college in which the student is earning a degree, or by the dean's designee, and only on the basis of such extenuating circumstances as serious personal illness and relocation because of employment. To stop attending a class without officially dropping the course incurs the grade of F. Withdrawal From University Any student who wishes to officially withdraw from the university must do so in person through the Office of the Registrar in Student Information Services (Administration Building, Room 119). Students must complete an application for withdrawal. Failure to officially withdraw will result in grades of F for the courses in which the student is enrolled. NOTE: From the beginning of registration for any term through the last date for late registration for that Academic 12:07:53 PM]term, students withdraw in the Registration Center. See the Schedule of Classes for specific dates. Withdrawal is not permitted beyond the dates specified in the University Calendar for that term. Requests for exceptions must be made within the next regular term following the term in which the grade was assigned. Exceptions are made to this policy only in cases of such extreme circumstances as serious personal illness and relocation because of employment. Withdrawal requests after the deadline should be filed in the dean's office of the student's major college or the Academic Counseling Unit for students with no declared major. Enrollment Transactions Enrollment transactions include registration, adding and dropping courses, and withdrawing from the university. The official date shall be the date that the request is submitted to the Office of the Registrar, subject to the final review and approval of the Assistant Vice Provost for Enrollment Services. If the final review reveals any apparent violation of the university's academic regulations and/or contractual relationships between the university and the student, the Assistant Vice Provost for Enrollment Services has the authority to suspend the transaction pending joint review with the college dean, the department chair, and the student's academic advisor. If the joint review verifies the legitimacy of the transaction, the official date will be that originally established. If the joint review culminates in a finding that academic regulations and/or contractual relationships have been violated, the entire transaction may be permanently invalidated. CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS Classification of students is based on the number of college level credit hours earned as shown in the following table. Classification Semester Hours Freshman 0-24 Sophomore 25-54 Junior 55-84 Senior 85 or more Special Students not working on a degree In order to avoid a possible delay in graduation, students who have completed the required number of hours to be classified as juniors but who have not completed their basic requirements in the Lower Division should schedule these uncompleted requirements during the first semester following in which such courses are available. Credit Hours and Maximum Load The unit of credit at The University of Memphis is the semester hour; a semester hour is defined as the credit earned for the successful completion of one hour per week in class for one semester; or two-three hours per week of laboratory for one semester. (A course which gives three semester hours credit will normally meet for three lecture or recitation hours per week, or for two lecture or recitation hours and two- three laboratory hours per week; or for some other combination of these.) Each lecture hour presupposes a minimum of two hours preparation on the part of the student. The minimum credit hour load for classification as a full-time student and the maximum loads are found in the table below. The maximum credit hour load includes all course enrollments for any term, both at The University of Memphis and any concurrent enrollment at other institutions. It does not include credit by examination. No student is permitted to enroll for correspondence or extension courses while carrying a maximum credit hour load. ACADEMIC FULL-TIME CLASSIFICATION AND MAXIMUM LOAD Minimum Maximum Term Hours Hours Academic 12:07:53 PM]Fall or Spring 2 **20.5 First or Second Summer * 9 Extended Summer only * 16 Any combination of Extended, First or Second Summer terms * 16 *Any enrollment of less than 12 hours for all summer terms combined is defined as being less than full-time. The minimum hours of enrollment required for full-time classifications is 12 hours for any combination of Extended, First and Second Summer Terms. **This maximum hour total includes the Applied Music Workshop (MUAP 1000) and the courses approved by the university to meet the physical activity course degree requirement. (See Graduation from the University for listing of approved courses.) A student who has a B (3.0) average or better for a semester may schedule, with the permission of the dean of the college from which the student is seeking a degree, a maximum of twenty-one hours for the following semester. Any or all of the above requirements may be waived at the discretion of the college dean or the dean's designee. NOTE: ID card validation of full-time for student activity purposes is based on a minimum of six credit hours per semester and does not necessarily constitute a full-time academic load. The maximum course load for any combination of concurrent summer terms is sixteen semester hours. The student's course load for the entire summer session may not exceed 16 semester hours. (This may differ from requirements for the Veterans Administration. Questions should be directed to the Office of the Registrar.)ACADEMIC STANDARDS Grades and Quality Points GRADESAt the end of each semester or summer term, instructors report to the Office of the Registrar the standing of all students in their classes. The grade of a student in any course is determined by class standing and examination, combined in such proportion as the instructor in charge of the course may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the quality of the student's work and the thoroughness of preparation. The instructor's evaluation of the student's work is expressed by the following grades which are converted to quality points for the purpose of averaging grades. Quality Quality Grade Points Grade Points A, Excellent 4 T (See below) 0 B, Good 3 CR, Credit 0 C, Satisfactory 2 W, Withdrew 0 D, Poor 1 AD, Audit 0 F, Failure 0 *S, Satisfactory 0 I, Incomplete 0 *U, Unsatisfactory 0 *The S/U grade is limited to certain types of courses such as practicums, practice teaching, etc. The IP (In Progress) notation may also be used in certain research courses to allow students time to complete research projects. These grades are only awarded for those undergraduate courses for which it is indicated in the course descriptions. All courses for which the student is registered are recorded as passed (with a letter grade), "T," failed, dropped, withdrew, audit, credit, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or incomplete. In no case is credit allowed in any course for which the student is not duly registered. Grade of Incomplete The grade of I (incomplete) indicates that the student has not completed the course for some unavoidable reason that is acceptable to the instructor. Unless the student completes the requirements for removal of "I" within forty-five days from the end of the semester or summer session in which it was received, the grade of "I" will be changed to an F, regardless of whether the student is enrolled or not. Extensions may be granted if the instructor's temporary absence from the campus makes it impossible for the student to remove the incomplete or in other circumstances acceptable to the instructor. Grades of incomplete earned during the student's semester of proposed graduation will delay the student's graduation until the end of the semester during which the incomplete is removed. A grade other than "I" or "IP" may not be changed Academic 12:07:53 PM]as a result of additional work performed by the student after a grade has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar. There is a Grade Appeals procedure described below. "T" Grade The "T" grade allows students to complete independent studies courses in variable time periods that might exceed a regular enrollment period. The following procedure governs the use of the "T" grade: 1. Prior to the registration period, the professor obtains approval of the chair and dean to use the "T" grade in a course(s). 2. The dean notifies the Office of the Registrar of courses for which the "T" grade may be awarded. 3. At the end of the regular term, the faculty member has the following options: a. Award grades A-F. b. Award an "I" grade if the faculty member feels that the work can be completed in 45 days. (If an "I" grade is awarded, a runner with the student's name on it will be sent to the faculty member during the 45-day period. The faculty member must record either an A-F or the "T" grade to prevent an automatic assignment of "F.") c. Award a "T" grade. If the "T" grade is awarded, the student must re-register for the course in order to earn credit. The "T" grade is not used in the computation of GPA. Repetition of Courses A student may repeat most courses in an attempt to improve the grade previously earned. There are some courses that may not be repeated for this purpose. Information concerning these courses may be obtained from the office of the chair of the department in which the course is offered. In some degree and major programs, there are restrictions on course repetitions even after drops or withdrawals. The student should always check with the major advisor before enrolling in a course a second or subsequent time(s). The university is not obligated to allow substitutes for repetition of courses which have been deleted from the curriculum. Credit by examination may not be used for the purpose of improving a grade previously earned in a course taken for credit. A student may not attempt the same course more than three times for the purpose of obtaining a passing grade or higher grade. Exceptions to this limitation may be made by the dean of the college from which the student intends to graduate, or by the dean's designee. These exceptions must be approved prior to the student's registration for the fourth and any subsequent attempts of the same course. The student's grade point average will be computed as follows: Grade(s) Included Attempt In Computation 1st Original grade earned 2nd Only grade in 2nd attempt 3rd and Grades earned in 2nd subsequent and all subsequent attempts calculated in grade point average.The record will continue to reflect all grades earned in the same course. Audit Courses Students who are registered for one or more classes at The University of Memphis may also register to audit a course with the approval of the chair of the department in which the course will be offered. Auditors are not required to prepare lessons or papers, or take examinations. They are not to take part in class discussions or laboratory or field work. Students auditing a course will receive "audit" on the transcript only if in the judgment of the instructor they have attended a sufficient number of classes to deserve the Academic 12:07:53 PM]notation on the transcript. Faculty will base their decisions for awarding "audit" only on attendance, since the student is not allowed by policy to participate in any other way. Persons who are not enrolled for credit courses may register for audit courses with the approval of the Director of Admissions and the department chair. These persons must have graduated from high school or be 18 years of age or older. A student may not change from a grade point basis to audit or from audit to a grade point basis after the last day to add classes for that term. Fees for audits will be assessed on the same basis as fees for credit courses. Credit/No-Credit Courses The university, wishing to encourage mature students to broaden their range of interest without jeopardizing their grades, allows students who have earned at least 60 semester hours with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 to enroll in credit/no-credit courses as determined by their college. Students are limited to one course per term and may not accumulate more than 12 semester hours on a credit/no-credit basis. (In most cases, Physical Activity courses are exempted from these requirements. See Graduation from the University.) Students who transfer from one college to another should be aware that credit/no-credit hours may be acceptable in one and not in another. Students may apply to take, on a credit/no-credit basis, a course that has been taken previously for a grade. In every instance, approval to register for a course on a credit/no-credit basis must be obtained from the advisor and the dean of the student's degree granting college. Credit hours earned on a credit/no-credit basis will be accepted toward degrees within the following limitations: The College of Arts and Sciences accepts hours earned on a credit/no-credit basis in any course that is not required for the student's degree. The Fogelman College of Business and Economics accepts hours earned on a credit/no-credit basis only in courses designated as electives in the student's degree program. The College of Communication and Fine Arts accepts hours earned on a credit/no-credit basis in any course that is not required for the student's major. The College of Education accepts hours earned on a credit/no-credit basis in any course that is not required for the student's major, professional educational requirements and endorsement requirements. The College of Engineering accepts hours earned on a credit/no-credit basis in any course that is not specifically required for the student's degree. The University College accepts hours earned on a credit/no-credit basis in any course that is not required for a student's Coordinated Study Program. A student who registers for a course on a credit/no-credit basis may change the registration to a letter grade point basis only during the add period, and a student who registers for a course on a letter grade point basis may change the registration to a credit/no-credit basis only during the add period. The student who successfully completes a credit/no-credit course will receive the appropriate number of hours as credit toward graduation. These hours will not be used in the computation of the grade point average. Undergraduate Grade Appeal Procedure This appeal procedure is designed to provide any undergraduate at The University of Memphis with a clearly defined avenue for appealing the assignment of a course grade which the student believes was based on prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or other reasons not related to academic performance. In all cases the complaining student shall have the burden of proof with respect to the allegations in the complaint and in the request for a hearing. Students pursuing the appeal procedure must proceed through steps 1-3 listed below and file for a hearing in accordance with the following time limits. Grade appeals for the fall semester must be filed in the Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs by March 15 following the semester in which the grade was earned. Grade appeals for the spring or summer semesters must be filed in the office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs by October 15 of the same year. If a student fails to pursue the procedure within the time limits, the disposition of the student's complaint made in the last previous step shall be final. If the dean or chair fails to respond to the student's complaint within the time Academic 12:07:53 PM]limits, the Undergraduate Appeals Committee will act on the student's complaint. The procedure is terminated if the student and the instructor agree on the grade or if the student fails to appeal a decision within the appropriate time limit. All correspondence and records will be retained in the office in which the complaint is terminated. Step 1 The student shall first consult with the instructor in an effort to provide a satisfactory resolution of the complaint. In the event the student cannot schedule a meeting with the instructor, the student may contact the department chair who will schedule the meeting between the student and the instructor. The only exception to this procedure is the case where the instructor is unavailable so that it is impossible to complete Step 1. Step 2 If the complaint is not resolved in Step 1, the student may present the complaint in writing to the chair of the department in which the course was offered. The department chair will attempt to resolve the complaint in consultation with the instructor and the student within a fifteen-day period dating from the formal presentation of the written complaint. The department chair may, at his or her discretion, counsel with the faculty of the department. If the department chair was the instructor of the course involved in the complaint or if for any reason the chair disqualifies him/herself, the student may proceed to Step 3. The student's grade may be changed in Step 2 of the appeal procedure by the written consent of the instructor and the student . Step 3 If the complaint cannot be resolved at the level of Step 2 within the prescribed fifteen-day time period, the student may appeal further by presenting to the dean of the college a written statement which clearly explains the basis of the appeal (prejudice, discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action, or other reasons not related to academic performance), the evidence for this appeal, and any supporting data. The chair must also forward a copy of all correspondence and records to the dean. The dean may utilize any resources available to the dean's office to resolve the grade conflict within a fifteen-day period. If the dean finds that the request does not have merit, the dean shall so notify the student, the instructor, and chair. If the dean and chair are in agreement that the grade should be changed, either raised or lowered, the dean shall be empowered to change the grade without the instructor's consent. Otherwise the grade shall remain as recorded Either the student or the instructor may appeal the dean's decision made under Step 3 by filing, in the Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, a written request for a hearing before the University Grade Appeals Committee within the time limit set forth above. In the event of such an appeal the decision shall be stayed pending the completion of the procedure in Step 4. The dean must be provided a copy of the hearing request. Step 4 The person requesting a hearing before the Grade Appeals Committee must complete a grade appeal form provided by the Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs by March 15 for grades earned the preceding fall semester and by October 15 for grades earned the preceding spring and summer semesters. All supporting documents should be included with this form at the time of submission. The Vice Provost for Academic Affairs will forward the request to the chair of the undergraduate grade appeal committee. The chair will subsequently distribute copies of the request to the members of the committee for consideration. If the committee finds the student's or the instructor's request merits a hearing, the committee shall notify the student, the instructor, the chair and the dean of the time and location of the hearing. If the committee finds that the request does not merit a hearing, the student and the instructor shall be notified in writing. The University Grade Appeals Committee shall function as a review board. The committee shall have the power to allow the assigned grade to stand or to raise or lower the assigned grade. All parties shall be notified, in writing, of the Committee's decision. The decision of the University Grade Appeals Committee will be final. The University Grade Appeals Committee shall be composed of seven members and seven alternates constituted as follows: A chair designated by the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, a faculty member and alternate designated by the dean of the college involved, two faculty members and two alternates elected by the Academic Senate, one student and one alternate from the college involved, two students and two alternates selected through the Student Government Association. Although the primary responsibility of the committee is to review appeals, the committee will report any obvious discriminatory or capricious conduct on the part of either the student or the instructor to the appropriate Vice Provost for consideration and action. COMPUTING GPA In computing a student's grade point average, all courses attempted are included except credit/no-credit, audit, incomplete, remedial and developmental, and satisfactory/unsatisfactory courses and "T" grades. As an example: a student carrying five three-semester-hour courses for a total of 15 semester hours makes the following grades: A, B, C, T, F, thus accumulating grade points in the amount of 12, 9,6,0, 0, for a total Academic 12:07:53 PM]of 27. In computing the grade point average, the number of hours attempted (except "T" grade) (12) is divided into the grade points earned (27) for an average of 2.25. Graduation: A minimum 2.0 grade point average on all work attempted is required for graduation. Academic Fresh Start An ACADEMIC FRESH START, allowing calculation of grade point average and credit hours toward graduation to be based only on work done after returning to college, is provided for undergraduate students who have gained maturity through extended experience outside higher education institutions and have demonstrated better than average academic performance following their return to The University of Memphis. Preliminary information and application forms may be obtained from the Academic Status and Retention Director. Requirements to be satisfied by a student requesting an Academic Fresh Start toward a baccalaureate degree are as follow: 1. Separation from all academic institutions for at least seven years. 2. After returning to college and prior to application for ACADEMIC FRESH START, completion of at least 24 semester hours of earned graded course work, at least six semester hours of which must have been successfully completed at The University of Memphis within one semester. 3. At the time of application, GPA of at least 2.5 for all work attempted after returning to college. 4. Formal application to the dean of the student's college, requesting that an ACADEMIC FRESH START be granted and describing an academic plan which must include the declaration of a major. Upon approval of the college dean, the student will be granted an Academic Fresh Start. It may be granted once. The student's permanent record will remain a record of all work; however, the student will forfeit the use for degree purposes at The University of Memphis any college or university credit earned prior to the seven-year separation indicated above. The date of the fresh start will coincide with the date of re-entry following prolonged separation, and the permanent record will note that a fresh start was made and the date of the fresh start. The record will also carry the notation, "GPA and credit totals are based only on work beginning with that date." That date will be treated as the date of entry in determining which catalogs may be used for graduation. The University of Memphis honors academic fresh start completed at other accredited institutions of higher education ACADEMIC STATUS AND RETENTION At The University of Memphis, students' academic status is denoted by one of three conditions: (l) GOOD STANDING (2) ACADEMIC PROBATION (3) ACADEMIC SUSPENSION Official notification of academic status is by means of the grade report processed to each student at the end of the regular semester or summer session. The academic status of probation or suspension will be stated at the end of the report of grades. Policies and procedures related to each of these conditions are outlined in the following comments. Good Standing Students are in good standing so long as their combined college level and developmental studies grade point average is equal to the minimum cumulative GPA required on the sliding retention scale as defined in this policy statement. The term good standing indicates only that students are meeting the minimum standard for retention in the university. However, in order to meet graduation requirements, students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.0. Academic Probation A student will be placed on academic probation at the completion of any regular semester or summer session when the student's cumulative combined college level and developmental studies GPA falls below the following: HOURS ATTEMPTED MINIMUM GPA 14.99 or less No minimum 15.00--29.99 1.40 30.00--50.99 1.70 51.00--67.99 1.90 68 and above 2.00 A student on academic probation who withdraws from the university during the first probationary semester will be "continued on academic probation." Withdrawal by such a student from any subsequent probationary semester will be treated as an academic suspension requiring clearance from the Academic Status and Retention Office for any future registration. Students who are enrolled Academic 12:07:53 PM]on academic probation are allowed to register for the following semester. However, students whose grades result in an academic suspension will be automatically withdrawn from the university before classes for that term begin. For the purpose of participation in extracurricular and organizational activities sponsored by the university, students are considered in good standing and eligible to participate while on probation unless other requirements are specified by a particular group, organization, or activity. Academic Suspension Students on academic probation who, at the end of the following term of enrollment, fail to raise their GPAs to at least the required minimum on the Sliding Scale Retention Policy above will be suspended. There is one exception to this policy: students on academic probation will not be suspended at the end of any semester or summer session during which a term average of 2.00 has been earned.1. A student who incurs a first suspension must remain out of the university a minimum of one regular semester (fall or spring).2. A student who incurs a second suspension must remain out of the university a minimum of one calendar year. 3. A student who incurs a third suspension must remain out of the university a minimum of three calendar years. 4. A student who has been readmitted following a third suspension and who then fails to meet the retention standards is ineligible for further enrollment at The University of Memphis. 5. Former The University of Memphis undergraduate students on academic suspension will be readmitted under the retention policy in effect their last semester at The University of Memphis. A counseling interview will be required prior to re- enrollment. Academic status will be determined by the Academic Retention Policy in effect in the current University Bulletin. Any course work attempted at another accredited college or university will be used in determining eligibility for readmission to The University of Memphis. The university office responsible for the administration of this policy is the Academic Status and Retention Office (Room 117, Administration Building). Recognition for Academic Performance There are several means available by which students may obtain recognition for outstanding academic performance. In addition to those listed below, there are other honors and awards listed in the descriptions of the various honors programs. THE DEAN'S LIST The Dean's List is composed of those students who meet one of the following criteria: 1. Completion of 6-8 graded hours in a semester with a semester grade point average of 4.00. 2. Completion of 9-11 graded hours in a semester with a semester grade point average of 3.66 or above. 3. Completion of 12 or more graded hours in a semester with a semester grade point average of 3.50 or above. When a course is being repeated for the purpose of improving a grade previously earned, the student must meet one of the criteria for the Dean's List eligibility as described above for each of two separate sets of courses and grade point averages: a. The number of graded hours and grade point average for unrepeated courses taken during the semester and b. The total number of hours and overall term grade point average for all graded courses taken during the semester. Remedial/developmental courses are not considered in calculating eligibility for the Dean's List. College level courses used to satisfy high school deficiencies will be considered in the computations to determine eligibility for the Dean's List. GRADUATION WITH DISTINCTION Students who meet the requirements described below are eligible to graduate cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude: 1. Fulfillment of graduation requirements 2. * Completion of a minimum of fifty (50) graded semester hours at The University of Memphis prior to graduation 3. Final cumulative grade point averages as follow: Cum Laude 3.2500-3.4999 Magna Cum Laude 3.5000-3.7999 Summa Cum Laude 3.8000-4.0000 *Recognition of graduation with distinction at commencement ceremonies will be based on the completion of a minimum of forty- five (45) graded semester hours at The University of Memphis prior to the final semester. (During the final semester, the student must also be enrolled for a sufficient number of hours to complete the required minimum of fifty.) This recognition is not an actual conferral of distinction. In order to be eligible, a student who transfers course work from another institution must have made the required average on all Academic 12:07:53 PM]work taken at The University of Memphis and must, in addition, have an overall average that meets the honors requirements above. In no instance may the GPA used for determining graduation with distinction be higher than that earned on courses taken at The University of Memphis. A student who already holds a baccalaureate degree is eligible for these distinctions if the requirements above (1-3 and following paragraph) are met and if, within the hours presented to fulfill the requirements for the second degree, at least forty-five additional graded hours have been taken at The University of Memphis subsequent to the award of the first degree. (These hours would be for new courses, not courses repeated for a higher grade. University of Memphis hours earned prior to the awarding of the first degree may count toward the fifty-hour minimum in requirement 2 above.) The GPA used for determination of distinction for the second degree will be calculated from all undergraduate courses taken. College level courses used to satisfy high school deficiencies will be considered in the computations to determine eligibility for graduation with distinction. Either the complete set of requirements governing graduation with distinction in the current catalog or the complete set in the catalog governing the degree requirements for the student's graduation may be used to determine honors. PRIVACY RIGHTS OF PARENTS AND STUDENTS The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, with which the university intends to comply fully, is designed to protect the privacy of educational records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review their educational records, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings. Students also have the right to file complaints with The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA) concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the Act. The provisions for the release of information about students and the rights of students and others to have access to The University of Memphis education records are published in their entirety in the University of Memphis Procedure--Privacy of Education Records-- which is available in the offices of the Registrar or the University Counsel. A summary is published each semester in the Schedule of Classes.ADDITIONAL MEANS OF EARNING CREDIT Advanced Standing Credit Credit toward a degree will be accepted only from college-level institutions for courses that are substantially equivalent to those offered at The University of Memphis. After the student has been approved for admission as a regular undergraduate, the Office of Admissions will evaluate credits for university-wide use. The Office of the Dean in each college has the authority for determining the use of acceptable credit toward specific degree programs in that college. (Also see Transfer Credit section below.) In computing the scholarship ratio or grade point average of a student who has earned an associate degree from an institution with a grading practice that does not reflect failing grades, only those courses for which credit was granted will be used. A student who does not earn the associate degree prior to transfer or one who attends merely to take courses will have the grade point average computed using all courses attempted at that institution. Transfer credit from colleges not accredited by the Tennessee State Board of Education and/or the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (or corresponding agencies for other states and regions of the United States) will not be accepted toward a degree or toward teacher licensure. Credit for Service in the Armed Forces Veterans who have completed one year or more of continuous full-time active military service will be excused from taking the required physical activity course(s) but must take HMSE 1100, Concepts of Fitness and Wellness. In addition, six semester hours of health and physical education credit will be allowed upon presentation of a copy of the veteran's report of separation (DD Form 214) to the Admissions Office. Veterans with less than one year of continuous full-time service who have completed recruit (basic) training while on active duty will be awarded credit as recommended in the appropriate military branch Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Forces Total physical activity course credit applicable to the baccalaureate degree cannot exceed 8 semester hours, regardless of the source. The Admissions Office should be consulted to determine whether additional credit may be allowed for training completed through formal service schools (DD Form 295). Certain subject standardized tests offered by the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (D.A.N.T.E.S.) may be submitted for consideration. Official D.A.N.T.E.S. transcripts are required. The maximum amount of credit accepted for applicable D.A.N.T.E.S. courses and/or correspondence and extension courses is 33 semester hours, and 20 semester hours of lower division credit for selected service schools. (This restriction does not apply to credit accepted by the University College.) An official evaluation of service credit is not made until a student enrolls as a regular undergraduate student. Credit awarded for completion of selected service schools will be governed by the recommendations at the baccalaureate level as Academic 12:07:53 PM]outlined in the current Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experience in the Armed Services. Noncollegiate Sponsored Instruction Credit may be obtained for applicable courses completed through certain non-collegiate sponsored instruction as recommended in the current A Guide to Educational Programs in Noncollegiate Organizations. No more than 20 semester hours credit for service schools and/or noncollegiate sponsored programs will be allowed. The Admissions Office should be contacted for further information. Advanced Placement Credit The University of Memphis participates in the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. To be eligible for credit, students must score a three, four, or five on the CEEB Advanced Placement Tests. Information pertaining to approved scores and credit to be awarded may be obtained from the Admissions Office. International Baccalaureate The University of Memphis recognizes high school student's participation in the International Baccalaureate Program and awards limited college credit for completion of selected courses. To be eligible for credit, students must earn a score of "4" or higher. Specific information on score and credit requirements are avaliable in the office of applicant services. Transfer Credit After enrollment as regular undergraduates at The University of Memphis, students should obtain prior approval from the dean of the college from which they are to graduate before taking a course at another institution for the purpose of meeting degree requirements at The University of Memphis. The student who intends to take a course at another institution should consult with the Admissions Office and obtain forms for use in securing the dean's approval. Courses taken without prior approval are subject to possible disapproval when they are presented for evaluation at The University of Memphis. Before credit earned at another institution can be transferred and recorded on a permanent academic record, the student must have an official transcript mailed to the Admissions Office and must contact the college dean's office to make arrangements for the posting of transfer credit by having the original copy of the form returned to the Admissions Office. The maximum credit hour load allowed for any term includes all course enrollments both at The University of Memphis and any concurrent enrollment at other institutions. (See "Credit Hours and Maximum Load.") Correspondence or Extension Credit The University of Memphis accepts a limited number of credits earned by correspondence and/or extension, provided that such credits are taken from an institution that is a member of the University Extension Association, or the appropriate regional accrediting association. The University of Memphis offers some work by extension but none by correspondence. Prior to a student's initial registration at The University of Memphis as a regular undergraduate, the Admissions Office will, at the time the student applies for admission, determine the acceptability of extension and/or correspondence credits earned at other institutions. After the student has been admitted as a regular undergraduate, whether a beginning freshman or a transfer student, credit applicable to any University of Memphis degree will not be given for subsequent correspondence or extension courses unless written permission from the dean of the degree granting college is obtained prior to enrollment in such courses. No student is permitted to enroll for correspondence or extension courses while carrying a maximum load at The University of Memphis. Not more than one-fourth of the semester hours applied on the bachelor's degrees may be earned by correspondence or extension or a combination of the two. (This restriction does not apply to degree programs of the University College.) A student who has completed thirty-three of the last sixty-six hours required for residence and who lacks no more than four semester hours toward completion of degree requirements may earn these final credits by acceptable correspondence or extension work, or by residence at another approved institution. In those instances in which the dean's office has granted such approval, thirty-three of the last seventy hours will have been completed at The University of Memphis. (For details of residence requirements, see Graduation from the University.) Credit by Course Placement In some departments, students who have obtained prior approval from the department chair may enroll in a University of Memphis course at the level for which they feel previous training or experience qualifies them and receive credit for certain sequential courses numbered lower than the one in which they enroll. Recording of credit for the lower numbered course(s) is contingent upon completion of the course with a grade of C or higher. Upon completion of the course written application to the chair of the department and payment of appropriate fees are required for such credits to be recorded. There is a fee for all placement credits Academic 12:07:53 PM]that are recorded. It is the same as that for credit earned through credit by examination. For information on the fees, see Expenses and Aid. FOREIGN LANGUAGE: In the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, all of the requirements and fees listed above are applicable and credit by course placement is limited to the following courses: Students whose first college-level course in a language is 2201 may apply to the department chair for credit for 1102 in that language, those whose first college-level course is 2202 or 2203 may apply for credit for 1102 and 2201 in that language, and those whose first college-level course in a language is a 3xxx course in composition and/or conversation may apply for credit for 1102, 2201 and 2202 in that language. University Credit by Examination Credit by examination refers to all of the types of credit described following this paragraph. Students may not take any examination for credit in a course previously taken for credit except to validate transfer courses for upper division credit. Students may, however, take an examination for credit in courses that were audited or in courses at a lower level than one that was taken for credit. Credit by examination may not be used to satisfy the Computation Intensive, Writing Intensive and Integration General Education requirements.CLEP EXAMINATIONS CLEP is a national program of credit-by-examination, sponsored by the College Entrance Examination Board. It offers students the opportunity to obtain recognition for college-level achievement. Some departments accept CLEP subject area examination credits as equivalent to departmental courses. No credit will be awarded for CLEP general examinations. Information on courses for which CLEP credit is available, along with information of fees charged, is available in the Testing Center. DEPARTMENTAL EXAMINATIONS Almost all courses in the undergraduate curricula, except for those of laboratory, research, and performance variety, are available for credit by examination. Students who believe they have already mastered the material of a particular course offered at The University of Memphis may take a departmentally administered examination for credit in that course. Students should consult the department chair to make application and to obtain information concerning the courses offered. The following regulations govern the granting of credit by examination: 1. Any student who has been admitted to The University of Memphis-full-time or part-time-may make application to take an examination for credit. A student who has been admitted but who has not yet registered for courses at The University of Memphis will have any credit earned by examination posted to the permanent record after enrollment. Any student (other than first-time freshmen) must have a 2.0 GPA to apply for credit by examination. 2. Permission to take a credit examination must be obtained from the chair of the department in which credit is sought and from the dean of the college in which the student is seeking a degree. When permission is granted and after payment of the cost of the examination, the Admissions Office will issue an official permit for the examination. (See Fees and Charges). 3. The form of the examination, the method of administering it, and the time of examination are left to the discretion of departments.4. To receive credit, the student's examination grade should be a grade equivalent of at least a C. There are no university restrictions governing the number of credit hours which may be earned through credit by examination; however, the individual colleges may have some limitations. Students should check with the specific college concerning its degree requirements. Credit is indicated on the student's record as CR. CREDIT BY PLACEMENT EXAMINATION In some departments in which placement examinations are given, a student may elect to receive credit for certain sequential courses numbered lower than the course in which the student was placed if prior approval was obtained from the chair. (The Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures does not grant credit on the basis of placement examinations. See Credit by Course Placement above.) A student may take the placement test, which is given at the beginning of each semester, to best determine the initial course in which to be placed. A student completing the placement test may apply immediately for the hours of credit warranted by the test score. The student must make written application to the chair of the department and make payment of appropriate fees for such credit to be recorded. There is no fee charged for taking placement examinations; however, there is a fee for all placement credits that are recorded. For information on the fees, see Expenses and Aid. University Credit for Experiential Learning Students seeking degrees in the College of Communication and Fine Arts, the College of Education, and the University College may be granted credit for college-level knowledge and understanding gained from work experience, life experience, or for certain non- Academic 12:07:53 PM]traditional instruction. The student who wishes an assessment of such learning prepares a detailed and documented portfolio of those learning experiences that are to be evaluated. Assessment by portfolio is reserved for knowledge and competencies which do not readily fit into the credit by examination procedures described above. More detailed information about procedures may be obtained from the individual colleges. For fee information, see Expenses and Aid. Graduation from the 12:07:53 PM]GRADUATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY GENERAL REQUIREMENTS GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHER LICENSURE CATALOG APPLICABILITY SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Courses required for all baccalaureate degrees are outlined in the following section; specific requirements for the individual degrees are in the Colleges and Degree Programs section. Requirements for the Juris Doctor degree are in the Catalog of The School of Law; requirements for graduate degrees are in the Catalog of The Graduate School. The following have been established as minimum requirements by the university for all undergraduate degrees offered. In addition, the student must meet the requirements for the specific degree as established by the college or department in which it is offered. A minimum of 132 semester hours is required for all degrees except the accountancy major in the B.B.A. degree. In some degrees and majors, the courses that may be used to meet the university requirements below are specified. The assistance of an advisor for the particular degree and major must be sought to determine which courses will meet degree requirements.GENERAL EDUCATION The general education program is that part of the undergraduate curriculum that promotes a common background for all baccalaureate candidates. The purpose of the general education program is threefold: to help students develop the skills necessary for completing a college career and assuming an active role in contemporary society; to assist students in gaining an awareness of the diversity of human endeavors in intellectual, creative, social and technological spheres; and to help students develop analytical and critical faculties that can be applied across the range of issues confronting them in the modern world. The general education program extends beyond particular disciplines and majors to make available to students the tools and awareness necessary for active, lifelong learning and for active, literate participation in society.

The state requires that students who did not earn one unit in American History in high school fulfill the American Heritage requirement during their first or second year at the university. Those students who use the G.E.D. rather than high school graduation for admission to the university will be considered as having the equivalent of a Tennessee high school diploma and thus, to have had the equivalent of American History in high school. This does not mean that a student admitted to The University of Memphis may take the G.E.D. as an exam for credit in American History. H.

Prerequisite: Satisfactory completion of the General Education English composition requirement. M. Integrative [I]: (3 hours) At least one upper division course designated as integrative and approved by advisor. Prerequisite: Satisfactory completion of General Education English composition, oral communication, and mathematics requirements. Graduation from the 12:07:53 PM]NOTE: Under most circumstances, transfer courses may not be used to satisfy the Computation Intensive, Writing Intensive, and Integrative requirements. COMPUTER LITERACY Students who entered The University of Memphis or any other institution as beginning freshmen in fall 1984 or later, are required to possess competency in computer literacy before graduating. Competency may be gained by either passing grades in designated coursework or passing a specially designed test. Courses that fulfill this requirement are specified by the college in which the student is enrolled for a degree. Students interested in taking the test should consult their college dean. GRADE POINT AVERAGE To receive a bachelor's degree from any of the colleges in the university, students must have a grade point average of at least 2.00 (i.e., two quality points for every semester hour attempted). If for any reason a student offers more than 132 semester hours credit for graduation, the ratio of two quality points to one semester hour of credit must be maintained. To attain this standard the candidate must have a C average on all courses attempted in the university. Students with transfer credit are required to maintain an average of C on all courses taken at The University of Memphis. RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS A student will satisfy residence requirements for graduation by earning at least twenty-five (25) percent of credit hours required for the degree at The University of Memphis. Thirty-three (33) of the final sixty-six (66) hours required for the degree must be completed at The University of Memphis. A student transferring credits from a two-- year college institution must complete, as a requirement for the baccalaureate degree, a minimum of sixty semester hours in an accredited senior institution. In addition, the student must meet the residence requirements for the specific degree as established by the college in which it is offered. Exceptions to residence requirements can be authorized by the appropriate dean. Residence requirements for specific degrees within each college may be found in the Colleges, Degree Programs and Courses section. For more details, the student should inquire in the office of the dean of the appropriate college. A student who has completed thirty-three of the last sixty-six hours required for residence and who lacks no more than four semester hours toward completion of degree requirements may earn these final credits by acceptable correspondence or extension work, or by residence at another approved institution. In those instances in which the dean's office has granted such approval, thirty-three of the last seventy hours will have been completed at The University of Memphis. TESTING AS A PREREQUISITE FOR GRADUATION Any or all students may be required to take one or more tests designed to measure general education achievement and achievement in their major as a prerequisite to graduation, for the purpose of evaluation of academic programs. Unless otherwise provided for in any individual program, no minimum score or level of achievement is required for graduation. Participation in testing may be required for all students, for students in selected programs, and for students selected on a sample basis. Details concerning these regulations and the dates of the examinations will appear in the Schedule of Classes each semester. FILING FOR GRADUATION All students are required to file an intention to graduate during the semester preceding the semester of graduation. The deadlines for this filing are included in the academic calendars of the catalogs and the schedules of classes. It is the responsibility of the student to insure that this deadline is met. Graduation from the 12:07:53 PM]REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHER LICENSURE An undergraduate student can be recommended for licensure to teach in Elementary Education (Grades 1- 8); Early Childhood Education (Grades PreK-3); or Special Education (Grades K-12); or Physical Education (Grades K-12) in the State of Tennessee by completing all degree requirements for that endorsement as outlined for the Bachelor of Science in Education in the COLLEGE OF EDUCATION DEGREE PROGRAMS section of this catalog. A student in any of these programs must (1) file an application for admission to the Teacher Education Program in The College of Education; (2) fulfill the requirements and application procedures for the Internship/ Student Teaching Program; (3) file an intent to graduate application before the university deadline; (4) have an overall GPA of no less than 2.50 and a grade of C or above in each required professional education course; (5) take the Core Battery and the Specialty area (if required) of the National Teacher Examinations (NTE); and (6) fulfill all other graduation requirements listed under the TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS: REQUIREMENTS section. Students entering the university for the first time as freshmen who wish to prepare for teaching careers in fields other than Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, Special Education, or Physical Education should see the academic advisor in the College of Education, Room 204. Graduate, special, and transfer students who wish to obtain a teacher's license should confer with the academic advisor in the College of Education, Room 204, concerning their individual requirements. CATALOG APPLICABILITY DEGREE/MAJORA student may complete the requirements for the initial degree under the provisions of any valid U of M catalog provided the effective date of that catalog is not earlier than the student's initial admission to U of M or some other accredited institution of higher learning. The degree requirements published in the Undergraduate Catalog issue of The University of Memphis Bulletin are valid for seven years from the beginning of the academic year to which the catalog applies. For students whose initial enrollment occurs Fall 1997-Summer 1998, this catalog is valid through Summers 2004; for those whose enrollment occurs Fall 1998-Summer 1999, the validity period ends Summer 2005. With the approval of the dean of the college through which the student's degree is offered, any student who had completed at least fifteen semester hours of course work and whose progress was interrupted by a call to active military duty may extend the validity date for graduation for any catalog valid at the time of the call to active duty. Though the student should attempt to complete requirements within the normal seven-year validity period, the dean may grant an extension commensurate with actual time served on active military duty and time required for directly related medical treatment that prevents the student's re- enrollment. Qualification for this extension is contingent upon re-enrollment within a period of time deemed reasonable by the dean. The extension is not allowed for a full military career. MINORThe seven-year catalog validity period applies only to degree requirements as specified in Graduation from the University and Colleges, Degree Programs and Courses sections of the catalog. It does not apply to regulations in the Academic Regulations section. Specific regulations apply for the year in which they appear in the catalog. Selection of a minor may be made from a valid catalog other than the one used for degree requirements unless the minor is restricted to a particular degree. Unrestricted minors may be selected from the same catalog as that used for degree requirements or from any subsequent catalog. Unrestricted minors approved too late for inclusion in the current bulletin may also be selected. In the case of both restricted Graduation from the 12:07:53 PM]and unrestricted minors, the GPA required for the minor is that of the degree-granting college in the catalog under which the student is graduating. Currently available minors are listed in the catalog index under Minor.SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE A student who completes the requirements for one bachelor's degree from The University of Memphis may receive a second bachelor's degree with a different title upon the completion of the curriculum prescribed in the current catalog or any other valid catalog approved by the appropriate degree-granting college. The two degrees may be conferred simultaneously or subsequently. All students who hold a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution of higher education, including The University of Memphis, may earn another bachelor's degree with a different title. Two options are available for satisfying requirements for the additional degree. In both options, students must meet university, college, and major/program requirements from the current University of Memphis catalog or any other valid catalog approved by the appropriate degree granting college. Option 1: The student must satisfy all University of Memphis degree requirements for graduation, including all university-wide requirements such as general education requirements and computer literacy, all college requirements, and all program/major requirements. This option may appeal particularly to those students who earned their previous degrees sufficiently long ago that they wish to learn and demonstrate the currency of their skills in writing, mathematics, oral communication, synthesis, and integration, as well as their knowledge of subject areas outside of their major. Option 2: In this option, the student's first degree will satisfy University of Memphis general education requirements. However, students who use this option must receive advising to make certain that they satisfy all external (State of Tennessee, Tennessee Board of Regents, etc.) requirements for a University of Memphis degree. Students seeking a second bachelor's degree and who have earned their initial baccalaureate degree from another institution are subject to catalog regulations applicable to transfer students. SECOND MAJOR Two majors in the same degree may be pursued simultaneously or subsequently. If a student completes the requirements from a valid catalog for an additional major for a degree previously earned at The University of Memphis, that major may be posted on the student's record if the student applies for the additional major through the appropriate dean's office.

The figures in parentheses after the course title denote the number of semester hours of credit for that course. If the credit is variable, to be determined by the department, that fact is indicated by the minimum and maximum credit, as BIOL 4000 (2-4). If the phrase "Same as . . ." and another course number appear in parentheses following the credit hours, the course is cross listed with a course in another department, and when offered by both departments, may be taken through either. If another course number in parenthesis follows the credit hours, it is the former number for the same course. Credit may not be received for both the former number and the current number of the same course. For those courses including regular laboratory hours, the lecture/laboratory hour distribution is written in italics near the end of the course description. At the end of many course descriptions, prerequisites and/or corequisites are listed. Students are responsible for meeting the stated prerequisites prior to enrolling for the course. A [G] at the end of the course description indicates that the course may be used to fulfill university general education requirements. These requirements vary somewhat according to the particular degree program or major. Similarly, a [W] indicates a course approved as writing intensive for some programs, a [C] indicates a computation intensive course, and an [I] indicates an integrative course. Courses are numbered according to the following system: 0001-0999 Courses for which the credit does not apply toward minimum degree requirements or for which credit is restricted. 1000-1999 Courses primarily for freshmen 2000-2999 Courses primarily for sophomores 3000-3999 Courses primarily for juniors 4000-4999 Courses primarily for seniors and for which graduate credit is not offered. (There is sometimes a corresponding 6000 number for which graduate credit is offered to graduate students who fulfill the additional requirements for such credit.) 1000-2000 level courses are lower division courses, 3000-4000 level courses are upper division courses. Course numbers have no reference to the semester in which the courses are taught. The Schedule of Classes is published a few weeks before priority registration for each semester and the Summer Session. It contains a listing of the specific courses to be offered, with the time, place and instructor in charge of each section. It also contains special announcements concerning registration procedures and courses which may have been added since the publication of the catalog. Copies are available outside the Registration Services Office, room 167 in the Administration Building.

Faudree, Ph.D., Dean Room 219, Mitchell Hall PURPOSESThe College of Arts and Sciences has three distinct functions within the framework of the university. 1) Its primary function is to offer a strong liberal arts program designed to help the students prepare themselves for life in their own cultural setting by acquiring the means and desire to continue the processes of intellectual development and character formation throughout their lives. "The purpose of education," wrote John Stuart Mill, "is to make capable and cultivated human beings." "Education has for its object the formation of character," wrote Herbert Spencer. We believe that people are people, no matter what their careers, and that if we can help people to become more capable and sensible, they will have better careers and lives. It is our belief that the best preparation for any profession or vocation is a thorough foundation in those major fields of human interest, which are included in the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. A program of liberal studies at The University of Memphis aims to provide the students with a store of factual knowledge, to introduce them to varying sets of principles, to stimulate them to think about and evaluate facts and principles, and to encourage them to order their own affairs and those of their society with the talent, insight, and discrimination they develop. 2) The College of Arts and Sciences offers this kind of education to the candidates for its own degrees, and to the students of other colleges of the university, all of whose degree plans call for courses in the arts and sciences.3) The college offers preparatory courses for students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, nursing, teaching, law and other professions; specific preprofessional programs, designed to prepare students to qualify for admission to professional schools, are available. ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLEGE DepartmentsThe College of Arts and Sciences comprises nineteen departments: Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Criminology and Criminal Justice, English, Foreign Languages and Literatures, Geography and Planning, Geological Sciences, History, Mathematical Sciences, Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology and Social Work; Aerospace Studies, Military Science, and Naval Science. Requirements for the majors and minors offered by these departments are listed in this section under Departmental Requirements for Majors and Minors. CONCENTRATION GROUPS The various offerings of the neneteen departments of The College of Arts and Sciences are organized into four concentration groups: HUMANITIES: English, French, German, Greek, history, Italian, Latin, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, Russian, Spanish. NATURAL SCIENCES: biology, chemistry, geology, physical geography, mathematics, physics. SOCIAL SCIENCES: anthropology, criminal justice, economics, geography (other than physical), history, philosophy, political science, psychology, sociology. The College of Arts and 12:07:57 PM]ROTC PROGRAMS: Aerospace Studies, Military Science, Naval Science. RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS University residence requirements are explained in detail in the Graduation from the University section. A transfer student in The College of Arts and Sciences must earn at least 6 semester hours in residence in the major subject and at least 3 semester hours in the minor. These credits may be earned only through regular class enrollment for a letter grade. PRE-PROFESSIONAL TRAINING Standing committees of the faculty are available to advise students interested in preparing for careers in various professional areas. Committee members representing departments of the university in which pre- professional training is given advise students concerning specific programs required by the various professional schools. Pre-Medical--The Health Science Professions Advisory Office, located in the Dean's Office, offers advising and career information to students planning on applying to the following health-professional schools: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, optometry, veterinary medicine and allied health fields including cytotechnology, dental hygiene, health information management, medical technology, occupational therapy and physical therapy. Pre-Law--In general, accredited law schools have not adopted specific requirements for pre-law education; they do, however, emphasize certain courses as being conducive to the development of the broad cultural background necessary for the successful study of law. Students enrolling in The College of Arts and Sciences and interested in applying to law school should see the Pre-Law Advisor for further information. Teacher Preparation--Students who wish to prepare for teaching careers in the secondary schools of Tennessee will be expected to complete a baccalaureate degree with a major in the intended teaching area, followed by earning a Master of Arts in Teaching degree program through the College of Education. Additional information on licensure requirements may be obtained from the dean's office in Arts and Sciences or the Office of Teacher Education in the College of Education. Individual program requirements described in the Undergraduate Issue of the 1997-1999 Bulletin of The University of Memphis are subject to change. Please consult the college level advisor for changes that may occur before publication of the next issue of this Bulletin; or consult the undergraduate bulletin website at: for the latest catalog updates.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees Offered The College of Arts and Sciences offers three degrees: the Bachelor of Arts, the Bachelor of Science, and the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. Foreign Language Requirements The foreign language requirement for all degrees offered through the College of Arts and Sciences is as follows:Two courses in a single foreign language at or above the 2000 level. Beginning in the Fall of 1990, all students who have not successfully completed first year language courses at an accredited institution of higher education and who wish to enroll in 2201 (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Russian, Spanish) will be required to take the placement test given by the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. Students presenting a language to meet university admission requirements cannot receive credit for 1101 in that language. For information about the dates and place of placement tests, contact the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. A student already having proficiency in a foreign language taught at The University of Memphis should enroll in a course at the level for which the student is qualified. This course can best be determined by taking the placement test given at the beginning of each semester. (Detailed information is available from the chair of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.) No credit is granted on the basis of the placement test. However, students whose first college-level language course is 2201 or higher and who pass this course with a grade of C or better may apply for Credit by Course Placement. The applicable fees are listed in the Miscellaneous Fees of the catalog. Students wishing such credit must make written application to the chair of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures (application forms are available from the department). This regulation shall apply only to the lower division, and credit gained in this manner shall not exceed 12 semester hours in any one language. For additional information, see Credit by Course Placement in Section 5 of this catalog. Once a student begins with a lower-division course, credit in all remaining higher-numbered courses in the lower division must be earned in sequence, without skipping. For example, students who begin with LATN The College of Arts and 12:07:57 PM]1101 cannot skip LATN 1102 and enroll in LATN 2201. This regulation will also apply to a student whose mother tongue is not English, with the following modifications: lower-division credit in the native language will be given when the student has successfully completed the English composition requirement for graduation (see Graduation from the University, for details) and has proven proficiency in the native language to the satisfaction of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. The student must make written application to the chair of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.

SCHOOL OF ACCOUNTANCY The mission of the bachelor's degree program in The School of Accountancy is to serve the needs of students, the accounting profession, and the general business community through teaching, research and service. Within this mission, the school offers students a balanced integrative approach to business education. In this interdisciplinary view, students must have a broad general education grounded in non-business courses, a strong supporting business acumen, and an interrelated view of accounting to the other areas of business. Specifically, accounting classes synthesize accounting with the financing, investing, and operating functions so that students can develop their critical thinking skills and apply them to making decisions on accounting and other business problems. Overall, the B.B.A. with a major in Accounting is built on the foundation of technical, interpersonal, and communication skills. This focus allows enhancement of careers and leadership to businesses and government units that would strengthen the economic development of communities, state, and nation. REQUIREMENTS FOR MAJOR AND MINOR ACCOUNTANCYProgram Options: The School of Accountancy offers undergraduates two program options. One option is to complete only the 128 semester hours which lead to the B.B.A. degree with a major in accountancy. The other option is the recommended curriculum for students interested in a professional career in accounting. It is a 158-hour professional program in accounting that combines undergraduate and master's degrees. Undergraduate B.B.A. students may begin taking graduate course work after they have completed 90 undergraduate credit hours, providing they have (1) a minimum GPA of 3.25, (2) a minimum 450 GMAT score, and (3) and minimum average GPA of 3.25 in ACCT 3110, 3120, and 3310. Students pursuing this option receive the bachelor's degree upon completion of the bachelor's requirements and the master's degree with a major in accounting upon completion of the full 158 semester hours. A student admitted to the professional program may take graduate courses only if she or he has completed the necessary prerequisites. Graduate courses may not be double counted for both the bachelor's and master's degrees.

Department of Management The effective manager of today must have competence in many disciplines, an understanding of a wide variety of relationships, and the ability to analyze evolving management requirements. Regardless of the functional specialty, the professional manager must also be a leader of people who knows how to organize and motivate groups of people serving the goals of the organization. Effective adaptation of management to such emergent conditions as the continued growth of science and technology, populations, and large scale organization demands a thorough grasp of management process theory including planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of operations. The management major is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of management concepts, theories and principles which will be useful in all kinds of organizations. All management majors take courses in management principles, business communication, human resources administration, organizational behavior, international management, and strategic management. These courses and others are designed to develop knowledge of organizations and administrative processes and enhance skills in interpersonal relations, written and oral communication, and work project development and completion. The program in management is intended to promote the development of general knowledge and skills which can be applied in virtually any organizational setting and which will continue to be important in the future. In addition to required core courses in management, students select among several more specialized courses to complete their majors. MANAGEMENTThe Major: A minimum of 21 upper division semester hours including MGMT 3215, 4420, and either MGMT 4510 or MGMT 4810 (If either MGMT 4510 or MGMT 4810 is used to fulfill a college core requirement, the student must take the other course to fulfill the major requirement.) The additional 12 hours of the 21 hour minimum for the major can be selected from the following: MGMT 4240, 4251, 4260, 4410, 4510, 4810, 4820, 4910, 4110-19. The Minor For students whose major is in another area in The Fogelman College of Business and Economics: (12 hours) MGMT3215, 4420, and 6 upper division semester hours in management. For students whose major is within another college of the university: (18 hours) MGMT 3110, 3215, 4420; ISDS 3510; and 6 upper division semester hours in Management. Department of Management Information Systems and Decision Sciences Managers and nonmanagers alike depend upon information for decision making. To be useful that information must be understandable, timely, thorough, focused on the decision at hand, and in the hands of the appropriate individual. Accomplishing all this is the challenge of Management Information Systems and the Decision Sciences. It requires a knowledge of individual and/or group behavior, the process of perception (how people select and interpret information), the decision tools they need, computers and communication technology, systems design, managing data, and the impact individual decisions have on the organization. Management Information Systems and the Decision Sciences include several specialized areas including Artificial Intelligence, Expert Systems, Telecommunications, Cognitive Processing, Production/Operations Management, Management Science, Decision Support Systems, Management Information Systems Planning, Decision Theory, Statistics, Data Base Management, Office Automation, and general applications of computers and microcomputers to business. Many Management Information Systems and Decision Science courses require substantial hands-on experience in computer labs. Therefore, the department does not allow credit by examination for upper division courses. MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS The Major: ISDS 2770 and a minimum of 21 upper division hours, including ISDS 3745, 3770, 3775, 3790 and 4800.

The Fogelman College of Business and 12:07:58 PM] The College of Communication and Fine 12:08:00 PM]THE COLLEGE OF COMMUNICATION AND FINE ARTSRICHARD R. RANTA, B.S., M.A., Ph.D., Dean Room 232, Communication Fine Arts Building PHILOSOPHYThe College of Communication and Fine Arts is focused ultimately upon visual and audible symbols, whose rational and emotional values it is the mission of the college to create and explore. In the belief that perception is largely shaped by experience, The College of Communication and Fine Arts offers a range of symbolically rendered experiences, both individual and collective, in the hope of broadening and sensitizing the perceptions of its students. The kind of symbolic experience that communicates emerges when, in Ruskin's phrase, "the hand, the head and the heart of man go together." Students in The College of Communication and Fine Arts receive individual and small group instruction toward this end. In the hope of furthering the capacity to impose a pattern on experience and to recognize the patterns offered by others, students of the college are exposed additionally to courses drawn from a broad base of the liberal arts. The faculty of the college represents a diversity of academic and artistic backgrounds and interests, reflected not only in its teaching, but also in research and creative activities. It is a faculty united in the attempt to maintain the highest standards in both classroom and studio work, standards that find their limits at last only in the mystery and wonder of the human experience from which they rise. PURPOSESThe College of Communication and Fine Arts has four primary functions. First, it offers courses of study aimed at preparing its students to work toward careers in the fine or applied arts, communications, or the performing arts, whether as practitioners, teachers, artists, or consultants. Second, the college affords broad exposure and instruction in fine arts and communication to students of other colleges in the university whose degree programs may be enhanced by such exposure. Third, with a view toward individual professional growth as well as general cultural enhancement, the college vigorously promotes both scholarly research and artistic production on the part of its faculty. Finally, the college seeks to enrich the cultural atmosphere of both the university and the community at large through a continuing variety of public programs, to include art exhibitions, media presentations, dramatic productions, concerts, recitals, lectures, seminars, debates, workshops, festivals, and the like. Through the diversity of these constituent elements, the college reflects the unity and challenge facing the communicative artist and scholar. Ultimately it is our goal to foster a more intense and profound awareness of the broad range of human experience from which the college derives its pertinence and vitality. ORGANIZATIONThe College of Communication and Fine Arts comprises five academic departments: Art, Communication, Journalism, Music, and Theatre and Dance.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees Offered A student may earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Arts degree, by majoring in one of the five departments that constitute The College of Communication and Fine Arts. The following is an outline by department of all majors and concentration areas offered by the departments in the College of Communication and Fine Arts. A minimum grade of C is required in every course applicable toward a major or minor. Every student should be aware that the mere completion of courses outlined below with a grade of C or better does not guarantee classification as a major or minor in the discipline concerned; the student must be recommended by the chair of the department in which the major or minor is sought. If, in the opinion of the chair, the quality of the student's work is not high enough, additional work, the repetition of courses, or other evidences of superior scholarship may be required. Credit in the College of Communication and Fine Arts may be granted for validated learning from experience or non-traditional instruction. Guidelines for this procedure may be obtained in the office of the Dean of the College of Communication and Fine Arts. The College of Communication and Fine 12:08:00 PM]The college requires a one semester physical activity course. A student may elect to take the course on a credit/no credit basis. Only students in the following programs may apply more than 8 semester hours of physical activity courses toward the specified minimum degree requirement: B.F.A. Theatre major with a concentration in Performance or Dance, or a Theatre or Dance minor. In addition to PHED 1000 level courses, MUAP 2002, DANC 1821, 1825, 1827, 2821, 2825, 2827; or THEA 2501 may be selected to fulfill the physical activity requirement. BACHELOR OF FINE ARTS DEGREE REQUIREMENTS In ART In THEATRE BACHELOR OF FINE ARTS (IN ART) The Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art is a professional degree. The requirements provide the student a greater opportunity for specialization in art than the other baccalaureate programs. The specific degree requirements are divided into five groups: (1 ) general education, (2) basic art courses, (3) courses in one of the five concentration areas, (4) elective courses in art and (5) elective courses other than art to bring the total to 139 semester hours. Advanced Placement Credit: A score of three (3), four (4) or five (5) points on the Advanced Placement General Portfolio or the Drawing Portfolio will entitle students to have their portfolios reviewed for the possible award of up to three credit hours. If a student submits art for two separate Advanced Placement portfolios (junior and senior years), a maximum of six credit hours may be awarded. For a grade of three (3) points in the Drawing Portfolio or three (3), four (4) or five (5) points in the General Portfolio, three hours of unassigned studio elective credit may be awarded. For a grade of four (4) or five (5) points in the Drawing Portfolio, three hours of basic art credit in ART 1311 (Beginning Drawing) will be considered. To determine how Advanced Placement credit will be awarded, all Advanced Placement portfolios must be reviewed within the department for consistency with standards appropriate to the performance level and range of enrolled students. New Department Advising: (1) First semester Freshmen are advised by the Academic Counseling Unit. Students without pre-college level requirements may request an Art Advisor during the first semester. ACU advises until a major is declared and until high school deficiencies are removed. (2) A General Art Advisor is assigned until a concentration interest is selected (see Concentrations.) (3) An Art Advisor is assigned only when an Art major is declared. The process of changing to a major in Art begins in ACU. (4) A Program Advisor is assigned when the concentration interest is declared. The Program Advisor advises students through the concentration admission process (see Candidacy Review), and remains as advisor until graduation. (5) The College of Communication and Fine Arts Graduation Analyst must be consulted at least twice: first, after accruing 100 hours; again during the semester prior to the semester of graduation. Permission of the Dean must be obtained before taking courses from another institution intended to apply toward The U of M graduation. (6) Transfer students with fewer than 40 hours are to see the Art Office for advising; transfer students with 40 hours or more must confer with the Graduation Analyst before seeking an Art Advisor. (7) The Art Department strongly recommends regular consultation with the assigned advisor. Assistance from the advisor, however does not relieve students of the responsibility of studying the appropriate catalog and fulfilling all degree requirements. Admission and Retention: A Candidacy Review is required of all students intending to major in art. Admission to The University of Memphis and completion of basic art courses do not guarantee placement in Department of Art concentration areas. Admission is selective and is based on a portfolio evaluation reflecting professional standards and expectations of the particular concentration. Space availability may also affect admission decisions. Concentration admission applications are to be made upon the completion of the basic art courses -- ART 1210, 1215, 1311, 1314, 2101, 2102, -- and any additional courses (listed below) required for a specific concentration. A portfolio that includes but is not limited to works from these courses is required as part of the application. Guidelines and application forms for admission to a The College of Communication and Fine 12:08:00 PM]concentration are available from the Department of Art office and from faculty advisors. Transfer students at the sophomore level or higher must meet concentration requirements. Required courses may be satisfied either through transfer credit or by courses taken at The University of Memphis. Upon completion of the Candidacy Review, the student is notified of one of the following: 1) acceptance to the concentration; 2) one semester acceptance on a probationary status; 3) recommendation to pursue studies in another area of art; 4) recommendation to correct deficiencies and reapply; or 5) denial of concentration admission. Concentration Entrance Requirements: Art Education; or Ceramics, Painting, Printmaking, and Sculpture; or Photography: ART 2313, 2314, (Photography applicants take 2702 instead of 2314; Art Education applicants take 3411 instead of 2314), plus two or more from: 2331, 2351, 2511, 2523, or 2701. Portfolios are to be presented for review in the second semester of the sophomore year or during the semester when the student completes these requirements. Permission to enroll in 3000 or 4000 level studio courses, except for Art 3411 and 3701, depends upon acceptance into a concentration. Graphic Design: ART 2213, 2221, and 2313. Students are to apply for portfolio review during the semester they complete the basic art courses and these three courses. Permission to enroll in any 3000 or 4000 level graphic design course is based upon the review. Interior Design: ART 2233 and 2234. Students are to include work from the basic art courses plus these two courses. Portfolios are reviewed when the applicant completes these courses. Permission to enroll in any 3000 or 4000 level interior design course is based upon this review.

BACHELOR OF FINE ARTS (IN THEATRE) The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree is a program specifically designed for students whose certain interests and abilities strongly suggest the potential for pursuing careers as artists in the resident, professional, community, or academic theatre. To expand the student's creative powers and deepen the commitment to a vocation in the theatre, the B.F.A. program offers the student (1) a basic probing of all the arts and crafts of the theatre; (2) an exploration in depth of one area of special interest; (3) the opportunity to participate creatively as a theatre artist through extensive production experience. Three areas of specialization are offered: I. Performance, II. Design and Technical Production, and III. Dance. Students entering the B.F.A. program will elect one of these three areas for concentrated study. The student normally will begin specialized training and the audition/portfolio review process not later than the sophomore year. Admission and Retention Criteria: Admission to the B.F.A. program is by application. To remain in good standing as a major, the student must be evaluated through the audition/interview or portfolio review/interview process. Following their audition/interview or portfolio review/interview, applicants will be notified as to whether they have been accepted into the program, accepted for one more semester on a probationary basis, or advised to pursue another degree. (1) Performance: Retention in the Performance concentration is based on a required audition and interview, twice yearly. In addition to the interview, the student is expected to present an audition consisting of a song, a group dance audition, and presentation of two monologues from plays of distinctly different styles and/or periods. The total time of the monologues may not exceed five minutes. (2) Design and Technical Production: Retention in the Design and Technical Production concentration is based on a required portfolio review and interview, once a year. In addition to the interview, the student is expected to present a portfolio of artistic and production work. This may consist of items including photographs, sketches, costume plates, elevations, lighting plots, and ground plans. (3) Dance: Retention in the Dance concentration is based on a required audition and interview, twice yearly. In addition to the interview, the student is expected to participate in a group audition and to choreograph and perform a two to three minute dance solo. Note: The fact must be emphasized that admission to the B.F.A. curriculum does not imply a student's permanent tenure in the program. Beyond the audition interview or portfolio review, the student's active participation in the co-curricular activities of the department will be assessed by the theatre and dance faculty. Artistic growth, development of technical facility, and continuing commitment to creative excellence on the part of the student will be evaluated. Permission to continue in the program will be based on this evaluation.Transfer of Credit: In certain cases students may be admitted to an advanced level of the B.F.A. program. Such admission will be based upon: (1) an audition and interview; (2) the student's previous course work in theatre, particularly in the area of special interest; (3) the student's previous involvements in production experience, (4) letters of recommendation from former Theatre Arts instructors and/or directors. Even if admitted to an advanced standing, the student will be required to remedy previous course deficiencies.Advising: Upon application to the B.F.A. program, each student will be assigned a faculty advisor. For this degree, 136 semester hours are required for graduation. A minimum grade of C is required in all theatre and dance courses applicable to the major. The student must maintain an overall grade point average of 2.0.1. General Education Courses English Composition (6 hours): ENGL 1101, 1102, with a minimum grade of C.

HONORS PROGRAM The Honors Program offers superior students the opportunity to engage in an intensive and individualized course of study leading to a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with Departmental Honors. The program enables honors students to develop their particular talents, interests, and abilities within a curriculum designed to encourage academic independence and creativity. Admission: To be eligible for admission to the Honors program, a student must meet the following requirements: (a) the completion of 55 semester hours of college course work (or Junior standing), (b) an overall grade point average of 3.25 or better, (c) a departmental grade point average of 3.25 or better. Students who have not met all of these requirements may apply for admission into the program, and their applications will be considered on a "provisional admittance" basis. Applications may be obtained from the Director of the Honors Program or from the main office of the department. Completed applications should be submitted to the Director of the Honors Program at least two weeks before the end of each semester. Students may be admitted to the program at the end of any semester (including summer semesters). Requirements: To graduate with departmental honors, an honors student must fulfill the following requirements:(a) The completion of at least 18 hours of honors work. Twelve of these hours must be in upper division departmental honors work, and a maximum of 6 hours may be in lower division or extra-departmental honor work.(b) The completion of an honors project or thesis in the senior year. (c) The maintenance of an overall grade point average of 3.0 and a departmental grade point average of 3.25.An honors student may earn departmental undergraduate honors credit in three ways: (1) by taking THEA 4980, "Honors Studies" (for a maximum of 15 hours credit); (2) by taking THEA 4999, "Senior Honors Thesis" (for a maximum of six hours); and (3) by taking THEA 4982, "Honors Seminar" (for a maximum of 9 hours) for a combined total of no more than 18 hours. This will allow honors students to enroll in those departmental seminars that most specifically reflect their particular interests in theatre. An honors student majoring in any field of concentration in the department will be able to substitute honors credit for certain track requirements for graduation. Contracting for honors credit in other courses or enrolling in Independent Study or Special Problems courses will not fulfill Honors Program requirements. After completing 6 hours of Honors Studies, honors students may begin work on their projects or theses. These projects will be under the direct supervision of the Director of the Honors Program although students may ask any member of the departmental faculty to sit on their committees (three faculty members will sit on each student's committee). Typically, an honors student earns 6 hours of credit for the project, 3 of which reflect a semester of research or preparation, while the final 3 hours reflect a semester of writing or assembling the project. The honors project does not have to be a thesis; the nature of the project will depend on the student's interests, talents, and course work and will be decided on an individual basis by the Director of the Honors Program. For further information about the Honors Program, contact the chair, Department of Theatre and Dance.

HONORS PROGRAM The Honors Program offers superior students the opportunity to engage in an intensive and The College of Communication and Fine 12:08:00 PM]individualized course of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree with Departmental Honors. The program enables honors students to develop their particular talents, interests, and abilities within a curriculum designed to encourage academic independence and creativity. Admission: To be eligible for admission into the Honors program, a student must meet the following requirements: (a) the completion of 55 semester hours of college course work (or Junior standing), (b) an overall grade point average of 3.25 or better, and (c) a departmental grade point average of 3.25 or better. Students who have not met all of these requirements may apply for admission into the program, and their applications will be considered on a "provisional admittance" basis. Applications may be obtained from the Director of the Honors Program or from the main office of the department. Completed applications should be submitted to the Director of the Honors Program at least two weeks before the end of each semester. Students may be admitted to the program at the end of any semester (including summer semesters). Requirements: To graduate with departmental honors, an honors student must fulfill the following requirements:f. The completion of at least 18 hours of honors work. Twelve of these hours must be in upper division departmental honors work, and a maximum of 6 hours may be in lower division or extra-departmental honor work.g. The completion of an honors project or thesis in the senior year. h. The maintenance of an overall grade point average of 3.0 and a departmental grade point average of 3.25.An honors student may earn departmental undergraduate honors credit in three ways: (1) by taking COMM 4980, "Honors Studies" (for a maximum of 15 hours credit); (2) by taking COMM 4999, "Senior Honors Thesis" (for a maximum of 6 hours); and (3) by taking COMM 4982, "Honors Seminar" (for a maximum of 9 hours) for a combined total of no more than 18 hours. This will allow honors students to enroll in those departmental seminars that most specifically reflect their particular interests in theatre and communication. An honors student majoring in any field of concentration in the department will be able to substitute honors credit for certain track requirements for graduation. Contracting for honors credit in other courses or enrolling in Independent Study or Special Problems courses will not fulfill Honors Program requirements. After completing 6 hours of Honors Studies, honors students may begin work on their projects or theses. These projects will be under the direct supervision of the Director of the Honors Program although students may ask any member of the departmental faculty to sit on their committees (three faculty members will sit on each student's committee). Typically, an honors student earns 6 hours of credit for the project, 3 of which reflect a semester of research or preparation, while the final 3 hours reflect a semester of writing or assembling the project. The honors project does not have to be a thesis; the nature of the project will depend on the student's interests, talents, and course work and will be decided on an individual basis by the Director of the Honors Program. For further information about the Honors Program, contact the chair, Department of Communication. The Department of Journalism JOURNALISMThe Journalism major at The University of Memphis offers preparation for careers in advertising, broadcast journalism, print journalism, and public relations.

ESSEX, Ph.D., Dean Room 215, The College of Education Building College of Education is dedicated to preparing students for careers in a variety of professional and related occupational areas. In helping the university pursue its three broad objectives of teaching, public service, and research, the College of Education is committed to the following missions: The first mission of the College of Education is to prepare teachers, other licensed school personnel, and educationally-related professionals who are qualified and competent in both practice and theory. The second mission is to conduct educational and educationally-related research and to engage in the dissemination of the outcomes of that research. The third mission of the college is tightly interwoven with the two preceding missions, that is, to provide teaching, research and service that extends beyond the confines of the campus, to make educational delivery available in its urban setting and at other outreach locations. The departments in the college value the pursuit and practice of quality teaching and research in a multicultural setting. Specifically, the college actively seeks to foster the advancement of knowledge and pedagogy involved in educational training in school and non-school settings. With a priority on urban- related studies, both faculty and students are engaged in timely, diverse experiences of a scholarly nature. This mission and vision for the College of Education is embodied in the theme of Educational Leaders. The college seeks to prepare such leaders who demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the learning process, skill in instructional planning and delivery, and a disposition to create dynamic learning environments that incorporate multicultural knowledge into instructional design and delivery. AREAS OF PROFESSIONAL TRAINING The College of Education offers a wide selection of general and specialized programs that are designed to prepare students for a variety of careers. Careers in Teaching One of the most important professions in a society is teaching its children and young people. Preparing students to become excellent teachers is a primary goal of the College of Education. A career in teaching offers a wide range of specialization choices and opportunities in prekindergarten, kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and senior high schools. Through the College of Education, there are programs at the undergraduate level for licensure in early childhood (PreK-3), elementary (1-8), special education (K-12), and physical education (K-12). Students who wish to prepare for other endorsements in Secondary Education and K-12 teaching fields will be expected to complete a baccalaureate degree in the appropriate teaching area followed by a fifth-year Master of Arts in Teaching or licensure program through the College of Education. Recommendation for teacher licensure in these areas is contingent upon successful completion of the Master of Arts in Teaching degree or licensure program. Preparation for the various teaching areas includes a significant professional education component that The College of 12:08:01 PM]emphasizes both a comprehensive knowledge base and an extensive skills requirement to ensure pedagogical competency. To meet these objectives, there is provision for significant laboratory and field experiences culminating in enhanced student teaching in the student's senior year. Careers in Related Occupational and Professional Areas Career options are available in related occupational and professional areas of Dietetics, Home Economics Instruction, Food Systems Management, Fashion Merchandising, and Home Furnishings Merchandising through the Department of Consumer Science and Education. Students have the opportunity to prepare for careers in Exercise Science and Health Promotion, Physical Education, Urban Leisure Leadership, and Urban Sport Leadership through the Department of Human Movement Sciences and Education. For additional information consult the College of Education General Advisor or the department chair. ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLEGE Five academic departments make up the College of Education: Consumer Science and Education; Counseling, Educational Psychology and Research; Instruction and Curriculum Leadership; Human Movement Sciences and Education; and Leadership. Three departments offer undergraduate degrees, and all departments offer a variety of graduate degree programs. In addition, there are several research and service units in the college: Advisory Services, The Bureau of Educational Research and Services, The Center for Higher Education, The Reading Center, The Center for Environmental and Energy Education, The Center for Research in Educational Policy, The Barbara K. Lipman Early Childhood School and Research Institute, and the University Campus School. College Honors Program The College of Education Honors Program provides opportunities for students of junior standing to demonstrate excellence in academic achievement. It offers a series of specially designed honors sections and courses from which 18 semester hours must be taken. A 3.25 grade point average must be maintained. Specific information about the College Honors Program may be obtained in the individual departmental offices.Academic Advising Student advising in the College of Education is an essential support service provided to assist students in the process of clarifying academic goals consistent with their interests, abilities, values, and resources. Advisors provide academic, career, and professional information to assist students in developing realistic personal and career goals. Advisors also provide information about university support services and resources available to students. All undergraduate students entering the college are advised initially by the College of Education general advisor. The general advisor assists students in becoming familiar with programs offered in the college and guides them through the beginning phases of their programs. Later faculty advisors or program coordinators in specific majors assist the students until graduation. This assistance does not relieve the student of the primary responsibility of studying the bulletin and fulfilling all degree requirements.

The Herff College of 12:08:02 PM]THE HERFF COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGRICHARD C. WARDER, JR., Ph.D., Dean Room 201-D, Engineering Building college's function is to serve the educational and research needs of the industrial community, the metropolitan area, the state, and the nation. It accomplishes this function by providing: (1) undergraduate professional education in the principal fields of engineering, (2) undergraduate education in both technical and educational technology, (3) graduate education in all areas, (4) a program of continuing education for the engineering and technological practitioners of the area, (5) assistance in the solution of industrial problems through utilization of physical facilities and the professional talents of faculty and students, (6) a forum for the interchange of ideas and experiences among members of the industrial community through conferences, institutes and short courses and (7) an increase in the accumulation of knowledge in special fields of interest by a continuing program of study and research. ORGANIZATIONThe Herff College of Engineering is organized into the Departments of Biomedical, Civil, Electrical, Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Technology. Except for biomedical engineering, each offers a choice of specialized four-year programs leading to baccalaureate degrees. Graduate master's or doctoral programs are offered in all of the engineering disciplines above. Students may also pursue the master's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering and in Technical Education. AdvisingHigh school students, in planning for careers in one of the fields of engineering, should take advantage of preparatory courses. Since engineering is the application of mathematics and physical sciences to imaginative and useful systems, those courses should be emphasized in high school preparation. Courses are available at the university for those not fully prepared. Early enrollment in the summer terms offers excellent opportunity to remove any deficiencies that may exist. Freshman students who choose to study in The Herff College of Engineering will be advised by an Engineering College counselor until a major has been selected; then they will be advised by a member of their major department. Internal changes of a student's major may be made efficiently without loss of academic credit. Many students have found that the study of engineering is an excellent preparation for medical school. Those students electing this option should consult the advisor for the College of Engineering. Those courses in biology and chemistry which are necessary for the pre-med option may be used as electives in the engineering curricula. However, the student is advised to secure permission to do so before enrolling for the courses. The student should also see the university pre-professional advisor in the dean's office in the college of Arts and Sciences.

RAMSEY FOWLER, A.B., A.M.T., Ph.D., Dean Room G-1 Johnson Hall College serves special academic needs of adult and other nontraditional students at The University of Memphis. It does this by offering students a wide variety of individualized degree opportunities, by its administration of interdisciplinary degree programs, and by its oversight of tele- instruction. For faculty across the university, the University College provides the structure to explore and develop interdisciplinary ventures that may later be subsumed into other degree-granting units, in addition to encouraging the development of interdisciplinary courses and promoting the uses of such alternative instructional methods as team teaching and directed study. Finally, University College seeks to create and maintain a spirit of academic community through careful and concerned advising and interaction outside the classroom among students, faculty, staff, and community professionals. With broad responsibility for nontraditional, interdisciplinary and credit continuing education, University College is The University of Memphis's college of lifelong learning. ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLEGE The University College offers interdisciplinary courses and interdisciplinary and individualized degree opportunities. In addition, it administers units that enhance higher education access for adults and provide them with support services. The college is administered by a dean, the dean's staff, and the University College Faculty Council, which is made up of faculty from the other degree granting colleges. BACCALAUREATE PROGRAMS: Through Baccalaureate Programs, students are offered the opportunity to work on the development and completion of individualized and interdisciplinary programs leading to the Bachelor of Liberal Studies or the Bachelor of Professional Studies degree. Such programs range from Biomedical Illustration to Services for the Aging and from Commercial Aviation to Medieval Tradition in the Culture of the American South. In some areas group contract guidelines exist to assist students in the development of their programs. INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS: Students majoring in any department in the university may enhance their academic program through an interdisciplinary minor. Minors in African-American Studies, American Studies, Judaic Studies, Religion in Society, and Women's Studies are offered.

ADMISSION The University 12:08:04 PM]Students are admitted to The University of Memphis through the Office of Admissions and Records. Application forms may be obtained from that office and also from Extended Programs centers. After admission to the university, if students choose to pursue an interdisciplinary or individualized B.L.S. or B.P.S. degree, they must submit a separate application for admission to University College. Inquiries from persons considering a degree through University College are welcome; persons who believe that their interests will be best served by a baccalaureate program emphasizing personally designed education through contract degrees should attend an inquiry session. Information about dates and times for these sessions, which are held several times a month, may be obtained by calling the University College office. When the University College application is submitted a $40.00 fee must be paid. This fee includes a $15.00 non-refundable screening fee plus a $25.00 contract/advising fee, refundable if the application is not accepted. Applications are reviewed by University College staff and, if appropriate, by selected faculty. After acceptance, students are advised in the development of their programs and instructed in a final special project by a faculty chairperson or a contract/advising committee chaired by a faculty member. A non- refundable $25.00 contract/advising fee must be paid when students are accepted. Students may apply more than the ordinary limit of transfer credit for extension, correspondence or armed services courses, provided the courses are an integral part of the coordinated study. BACCALAUREATE PROGRAMS The Contract Degree Students enrolling in the University College pursue either of two degrees: the Bachelor of Liberal Studies (B.L.S.) or the Bachelor of Professional Studies (B.P.S.). Both of these degrees must be awarded for programs that are systematic, interdisciplinary, and individualized. Students and advisors will use learning contracts to design individual studies. All contracts will be reviewed and approved by the administration of the University College. A Contract/Advising Committee will assist the student in the development and execution of a degree program that serves the student's needs and meets the academic requirements of the University College and of The University of Memphis. The chairperson and one other committee member must be regular or adjunct members of The University of Memphis Faculty. A third committee member is optional; this person may be a faculty member, an appropriate student, or an off-campus resource person. The committee may direct the student in the preparation of a portfolio to obtain credit for knowledge gained through experience or nontraditional instruction; see Expenses and Aid for a description of credit evaluation fees. The Baccalaureate Contract will include work in these major areas: General Education, Coordinated Study, Thematic Studies, Special Project, and Electives. General Education The general education program is that part of the undergraduate curriculum that promotes a common background for all baccalaureate candidates. The purpose of the general education program is threefold: to help students develop the skills necessary for completing a college career and assuming an active role in contemporary society, to give students an awareness of the diversity of human endeavors in intellectual, creative, social, and technological spheres, and to help students develop analytical and critical faculties that can be applied across the issues confronting them in the modern world. Above all, the general education program should make available to the student the tools and awareness necessary for active, lifelong learning and for active, literate participation in society. Thematic Studies Thematic Studies cross departmental and disciplinary lines to examine a theme, problem, issue, or epoch from several points of view. As upper-division courses, they are designed to provide ways for undergraduates to integrate the full scope of their studies more effectively than they are able to do within The University 12:08:04 PM]the traditional departmental structure. Thematic Studies do, however, require the special knowledge and expertise learned from and fostered by the traditional disciplines. All students will complete a minimum of six semester hours of thematic studies courses. Coordinated Study The Individualized Study component of the program includes a Coordinated Study Program of at least 30 to 36 upper-division hours in at least two academic disciplines followed by the Special Project described below. Credit may be earned through courses offered by departments in the other degree-granting colleges, credit by examination, credit for experiential learning, transfer credit, internships or apprenticeships, independent studies, and additional Thematic Studies courses. Students may apply more than the ordinary limit of transfer credit for extension, correspondence, or armed services courses, provided the courses are an integral part of the Coordinated Study. For a University College student, the Coordinated Study Program corresponds to a departmental major. Students must earn a C or above in each graded course. All Coordinated Study programs must include a minimum of nine graded upper division hours taken at The University of Memphis. These hours must be earned in courses from two or more departments. A maximum of 33 hours for portfolio-based credit for experiential learning may be applied toward a degree. This learning must be related to the Coordinated Study. The Special Project The Special Project will be designed as a synthesizing activity, interdisciplinary in nature, by which the student demonstrates in a sustained manner comprehension and command of the complex skills and understanding encompassed by the Coordinated Study program. A faculty advisor/chairperson supervises the student's work on the project. The Special Project carries 3 or 6 semester hours credit and is preceded by the project planning seminar or an equivalent 3 credit course.. Students must earn at least a grade of C on their Special Projects. Projects must also receive administrative approval before students are certified for graduation.ElectivesStudents are not required to take electives. They may include courses in any subject area as electives in their degree program. Computer Literacy This requirement can be satisfied by taking one of the following courses or course combinations or another course of study approved by the dean: COMP 1200; ISDS 2750; ACCT 2410; ART 3225; ART 4222; JOUR 2121; JOUR 3900; ICL 3600; CIVL 2107 and CIVL 3101; ELEC 1206 and ELEC 1207; MECH 1307 and MECH 3341; TECH 1010 or 1210 and 3233, NURS 3003. EvaluationThe following methods are used to evaluate a student's performance: the traditional grading systems, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory and Credit/No Credit options supplemented by written narrative evaluations, credit or placement by examination, Advanced Placement examinations for degree credit where these are available, and credit for validated learning from experience or non-traditional instruction. Of the 132 semester hours required for graduation, at least 33 of the last 66 hours must be earned through instruction from The University of Memphis. HonorsStudents in University College may earn Honors distinction by fulfilling requirements for the Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors Program or the Individual Thematic Honors Program. Both of these programs require 18 hours of upper division course work, some of which may count toward the Bachelor of Liberal Studies, Bachelor of Professional Studies, or general education requirements, and some of which may be part of the The University 12:08:04 PM]student's elective hours.

The committee serves to inform students of different requirements such as languages and natural and social sciences. Dr. Stephen D. Benin, Judaic Studies, is chair and advisor. Independent Departments and 12:08:05 PM]INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS There are several independent units which contribute to undergraduate programs. The independent departments or programs included here are University Honors Program, The School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, Interdisciplinary Studies, The University of Memphis Libraries, the Orientation Program, and Remedial and Developmental Studies. THE NATIONAL STUDENT EXCHANGE: The University of Memphis is a member of the National Student Exchange (NSE). Students at NSE member institutions may spend a semester or up to a full year at other participating institutions, while paying tuition and fees typically comparable to costs of attending The University of Memphis. Students might exchange to experience a different part of the country or to pursue special academic opportunities offered by other member institutions. Over 130 member institutions in nearly every state and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have exchanged over 40,000 students since the program was established in 1968. Participating students must have a 2.5 grade point average at the time of application for an NSE exchange. Applications are screened by The University of Memphis and will include biographical essays, transcripts, and letters of reference from faculty. Institutions to which students are applying then select incoming exchange students based on how many students they are able to accept and the strength of the students' applications. Ninety-seven percent of students are placed at their first, second, or third choice exchange institutions; 84% are placed at their first choice institution. For more information and applications see the NSE coordinator in the University Honors Program office. University Honors Program University Honors Course Descriptions School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interdisciplinary Studies The University of Memphis Libraries Orientation Program Remedial and Developmental Studies R&DS Course Descriptions UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM DAVID PATTERSON, Ph.D., Director Room 404, Jones Hall The Honors Program provides exceptional educational opportunities for highly motivated and able students, including special curricular options and the opportunity to earn Honors distinction; an extensive co- curricular program emphasizing out-of-classroom experiences such as field trips, cultural events, or discussions with visiting scholars; and a social environment in which to meet other Honors students. The Honors Program also works individually with students planning for study abroad and other student exchange experiences, in pursuing career oriented or community service oriented internships, and in preparing applications for scholarships and career and graduate study opportunities. The Honors Program works closely with the Undergraduate Research Scholar Program, enabling students to develop research proposals with faculty mentors. Successful proposals and projects provide students invaluable hands-on experience with research in their academic field, including the possibility of presenting a paper based on the project at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research, held each year on a different university campus. The designation of "Undergraduate Research Scholar" is added to the transcripts of those students who (1) present research projects at The University of Memphis Works in Progress Symposium; (2) are invited to the National Conference for Undergraduate Research (NCUR); and (3) meet all other requirements for a degree with honors. Independent Departments and 12:08:05 PM]Students may earn Honors distinction by meeting requirements for the Honors Certificate, based on completion of 12 hours of Honors course work, plus the Honors Forum, usually earned in the freshman and sophomore years; and/or fulfilling requirements for one of several Honors options offered in conjunction with the student's major or Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors program, which is open to students in most majors. Appropriate Honors distinction is indicated on the student's transcript and is recognized at graduation. See Curriculum and Requirements below for detailed descriptions of these program options. The University Honors Program is governed by the Honors Council, a committee composed of the Director of the Honors Program, the Assistant Director of the Honors Program, six faculty members chosen by the Academic Senate, and two honors students elected by the Honors Student Association. The program is housed in Old Brister Library, Room 115, where the office of the director is located. A seminar-conference room and an honors lounge, both open to all students who are active in the Honors Program, are also located there. Admission and Program Standards Incoming freshmen who score at least 27 on the ACT, or its equivalent on other tests, are invited to participate. Transfer students or students previously enrolled at The University of Memphis are eligible for the program if they have an overall grade point average of 3.00 for freshmen and sophomores and 3.25 for upper-division students. Those who do not qualify in one of these ways will be considered for provisional acceptance upon direct application or receipt by the director of a recommendation from high school or college faculty. Students whose overall grade point average is below the requirement, but who would qualify based on grade point performance from the most recently completed full-time semester are especially encouraged to apply for provisional admittance. During the freshman and sophomore years the honors participant must maintain an overall grade point average of at least 3.0 to remain in good standing in the program; the minimum grade point average for continuing at the junior and senior levels is 3.25. There is provision for a one-semester probationary period before a participant is discontinued. Provisionally admitted students must maintain the 3.00 or 3.25 in each semester of Honors enrollment as long as their overall grade point average continues to be below the requirement for regular admittance to the program. A minimum grade of B is required in each honors course for it to count toward fulfilling the honors course requirement, but regular credit for the course will be earned if the grade is lower than a B. Curriculum and Requirements The Honors curriculum includes Honors sections of general education courses and other courses that fulfill special BA/BS requirements (for students pursuing the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degrees). Honors programs offered by some major departments also offer special Honors sections of courses required for the major. Honors sections have the advantage of small class size, specially selected faculty, teaching that emphasizes student participation, and assignments that encourage students to think independently. Students should consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for the roster of UNHP courses and departmental Honors sections and for the University Honors Program discussion in the descriptive section of the schedule, which follows the alphabetical listing of courses by department. Complete information, including course descriptions, is available directly from the Honors office. In addition to Honors sections of regularly offered courses, the Honors Program also offers courses designed specifically for Honors students. Courses carrying the UNHP prefix are designed for students pursuing the Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors curriculum or the Honors Certificate. Department and college Honors programs may also design special Honors courses; these courses usually are offered to majors only, but in some cases are open to other Honors students as well. Students also may earn Honors credit through participation in co-curricular programs; by designing their own special projects based on independent study, field work, or an internship experience (see UNHP 2900 and 4900 course descriptions); or by contracting for special projects within the context of a regularly scheduled course not officially offered as an Honors course. Within limits defined below, credit earned in these ways counts toward the Honors Certificate and may count toward other Honors options. Detailed Independent Departments and 12:08:05 PM]information about earning Honors credit through these approaches is available in the Honors office. THE HONORS CERTIFICATE: The Honors Certificate typically is based on credit for Honors sections of general education courses, but some credit toward the certificate may be earned in other ways. Requirements include the completion of 12 hours of Honors course work and the Honors Forum. (See UNHP 1100 for course description of Honors Forum.) Students are encouraged to pursue the Certificate during the freshman and sophomore years, but requirements may be completed at any point in the student's career. Students must have a 3.25 cumulative grade point average and a 3.25 average for Honors hours upon fulfillment of requirements to qualify for the certificate. "C" grades do not earn Honors credit, nor do they count toward the Honors Certificate. The following stipulations apply to the Honors Certificate: 1. Students may earn Honors credit for courses that count toward their majors, but unless these courses also earn general education or BA/BS credit, no more than three hours credit toward the certificate will be awarded for Honors work within the major.2. No more than three hours credit may be earned on a contract basis. 3. No more than three hours credit may be earned through UNHP 2900 or UNHP 4900. DEPARTMENT AND COLLEGE HONORS PROGRAMS: Some academic departments offer honors programs based on work in the major. Departments in the College of Business offer a college-wide program for students pursuing the Bachelor of Business Administration, and the College of Education offers students the opportunity to earn Honors distinction through special projects and independent study. Generally speaking, students must have a 3.25 cumulative grade point average to pursue and receive department or college Honors. Consult the specific department or college listing in this catalog for detailed requirements, or contact the Honors Program office for a listing of departments offering Honors work in the major. The Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors Program, which features interdisciplinary work outside the major department, also includes work within the major as a special emphasis for completion of program requirements.THE INTERDISCIPLINARY LIBERAL ARTS HONORS PROGRAM: Open to students in most majors (including students also pursuing department or college Honors), the Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors Program enriches the liberal education component of the Bachelor's degree. Since Honors students have a special potential to contribute to the discussion of public issues, regardless of their major, Liberal Arts Honors places strong emphasis on preparing students for citizenship and engagement in public discourse. This theme is the organizing principle for Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors. An additional emphasis within the major, including participation in an individually designed Honors project and writing an Honors thesis, complements the interdisciplinary theme. Students may pursue and earn Liberal Arts Honors if they have a 3.25 cumulative grade point average. It is not necessary to have earned the Honors Certificate to pursue Liberal Arts Honors. This program requires 18 hours of course work, some of which may count toward Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, or general education requirements; some of which may count toward major requirements; and some of which will be part of the student's elective hours. Applicability of UNHP courses designed for Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts to general education and to B.A. and B.S. requirements is periodically evaluated. Information on current applicability for specific courses is available through the Honors Office. The distribution of course requirements is described below. 1. UNHP 3000: Human Communities (3 hours) 2. Interdisciplinary Seminars (9 hours) Three additional three-credit-hour interdisciplinary seminars, at least one from each of three different categories. Categories are based on the shell course concept. Shell courses specify goals and identify common concepts for the course, but specific topics vary from semester to semester. a. UNHP 4101-4199: Contemporary Issues b. UNHP 4201-4299: Cross-Cultural Perspectives Independent Departments and 12:08:05 PM]c. UNHP 4301-4399: Science and Technology d. UNHP 4401-4499: Interdisciplinary Special Topics 3. Honors Experience in Major (3 hours) A specially designed Honors experience in the context of the major. May include special methodological experiences, internships, tutorials and readings, creative projects, applied projects such as evaluation research or investigative case studies, or enrollment in selected graduate courses. These courses typically will be offered with a departmental prefix and number, but UNHP 4900: Advanced Honors Projects, may be used in the absence of an appropriate departmental listing. 4. UNHP 4999: Honors Thesis (3 hours) In conjunction with a faculty mentor from the student's major department. Guidelines for students and faculty are available from the Honors Program Office. The Honors Program also conducts workshops for students undertaking the thesis. Students will register for the thesis in UNHP 4999 or the appropriate departmental course. THE INDIVIDUAL THEMATIC HONORS PROGRAM: The Individual Thematic Honors Program is an upper division Honors program option open to students in all majors. The Individual program enables students to propose a theme and design their own Honors program by selecting courses from different departments that apply to the chosen theme. The Individual Thematic Honors Program recognizes the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary fields of inquiry, where ideas, issues, and problems can benefit from the perspectives of more than one discipline. Individual Thematic Honors programs will have individual titles to be listed on the student's transcript. Students may pursue and earn Individual Thematic Honors if they have a 3.25 cumulative grade point average. The Individual Program requires 18 hours of upper division coursework, with 12 hours to be selected from honors sections of department or general education courses, courses offered by the Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors Program (see description above), or honors contracts for other courses. Courses selected to fulfill this 12 hour component of the Individual program may also be applied to general education, major, or other degree requirements as appropriate. The remaining six hours required for this eighteen hour program include a three hour individually designed independent study that encourages students to integrate concepts from the other courses and a three hour honors thesis. Individual Thematic Honors requires a proposal explaining the thematic rationale and discussing the selected courses that will apply to the program. The application is designed with the guidance and approval of a faculty mentor who will also work with the student on the three hour independent study and three hour Honors thesis. The proposal must be approved by the Honors Council. For more information consult with the Honors Director and obtain the guidelines and application form for the Individual Thematic Honors Program. (Note: Where a department/college Honors option is unavailable to students in particular majors, Individual Thematic Honors proposals may also be based on thematic work within a particular department.) The distribution of course requirements is described below. 1. Twelve hours of Honors courses selected by the student as appropriate to the program theme. Will typically be four courses chosen from upper division general education Honors sections, department Honors courses, Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors courses (see description for Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts Honors above), and other courses for which the student will contract for Honors credit. 2. An individually designed independent study that enables the student to integrate concepts from the other courses as they apply to the course theme. Independent study awards three hours credit and may be based on readings, field work, or research as appropriate to the Individual Thematic Honors emphasis. Students may register for the independent study courses offered by their major department if appropriate or may register for UNHP 4900 Honors Projects for three hours credit to fulfill requirement.3. An Honors thesis for three hours credit, conforming to the expectations for the Honors thesis as outlined by the University Honors Program. Students will register for UNHP 4999 Honors Thesis or an equivalent department course. 12:08:06 PM]ANTHROPOLOGY PROFESSOR LINDA A.

Last Updated: 6/12/15 12:08:07 PM]CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR HENRY KURTZ, Chair Room 210, J.M. Smith Hall Department of Chemistry offers courses leading to the B.S. degree with a major in chemistry. The department also offers a program culminating in the professional degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (B.S.Ch.). This program is designed to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society, and is undertaken primarily by students who desire to go directly to positions in the chemical industry, or to enroll for postgraduate study in chemistry. SEQUENCE OF COURSES Students who present credit for at least two years of high school mathematics (including algebra), or who have an ACT mathematics score of 22 or better, should enroll in CHEM 1121, 1131 if they plan to take more than one year of college chemistry, or plan to major in either a natural science or in civil, mechanical, or electrical engineering. CHEM 1100 is a one-semester course for students of limited preparation in mathematics whose curriculum calls for the CHEM 1121/1131-1122/1132 sequence. CHEM 1101-1102 is a two-semester sequence for students interested in the science of chemistry, but is not credited toward a major in chemistry or physics. It does fulfill the university science requirements of other majors. Credit may not be received for both CHEM 1100 and CHEM 1131 simultaneously. These courses emphasize fundamental principles and concepts and are designed for nonscience ma]ors interested in a study of several areas of physical science. GENERAL EDUCATION NATURALSCIENCE REQUIREMENTS Completion of the following 8-credit hour sequences will satisfy one of the options for the General Education Natural Science requirement: CHEM1101(4)/1102(4) OR CHEM 1121(1)/1131(3)/ 1122(1)/1132(3). ADVANCED PLACEMENT Beginning students who have had previous high school training in chemistry are invited to apply for advanced placement. LABORATORY SAFETY ANDCOURSE REQUIREMENTS Laboratory safety is strictly practiced in the Department of Chemistry. Approved eye protection must be worn as required in all chemical laboratories. In addition, to ensure that students enrolled in laboratory courses learn the necessary safety information to safely participate in the laboratory course, all prerequisites and/or corequisites for all laboratory courses are strictly enforced. As a result, when a student enrolls in a laboratory course without prior completion of the necessary prerequisite or corequisite, the student will be dropped from the laboratory course. In addition, when a student simultaneously enrolls in a laboratory course and corequisite course, but subsequently drops or discontinues the corequisite course, the student will be dropped from the laboratory course. In the event any student fails to comply with any safety requirements of the Department of Chemistry, the department has the right to not allow the student to perform laboratory work, or to withdraw the student from the laboratory course, as appropriate.

Courses with no indications of offering are offered either every semester or as needed. There is no guarantee that courses will always be offered as indicated. Always check the Schedule of Classes for availability. APPLIED MUSIC (MUAP) Applied music courses are divided into two broad categories: (1) small group or individual lessons in vocal or instrumental performance and (2) musical ensembles. Small group lessons in vocal or instrumental performance are provided through MAJOR GROUP INSTRUCTION (see the explanation below under MAJOR GROUP INSTRUCTION). Individual lessons in vocal or instrumental performance are offered at LOWER DIVISION and UPPER DIVISION levels (see the explanation below under LOWER DIVISION COURSES and UPPER DIVISION COURSES). Major group or individual lessons in vocal or instrumental performance are given by university faculty who are members of the relevant Applied Music Division. All students who wish to enroll in small group or individual lessons in vocal or instrumental performance must perform an audition for the members of the appropriate Applied Music Division or for a designate of the appropriate division. Because the number of students who can be accepted is limited, it is advisable that the student audition as early as possible to be assured a place with the requested teacher. Practice facilities are provided without charge, but there are additional fees for the individual lessons (see the explanation below under FEES), and a deposit is required for practice room keys. Examinations for courses in which the student is to receive credit for small group or individual lessons in vocal or instrumental performance are called Board Exams. For Board Exams, each student performs musical selections and/or technical exercises of a grade of difficulty appropriate to the level of instruction in which the student is enrolled. The board hearing the exam is made up of the members of the appropriate Applied Music Division (for further information, see the explanation below under EXAMINATIONS). APPLIED 12:08:34 PM]Music majors at The University of Memphis are expected to participate in Music Department ensembles; each degree program has specific or general ensemble requirements (see above under the various degree requirements). Non-music majors enrolled at The University of Memphis as degree-seeking students may enroll and be accepted for applied instruction where staff time is available. If accepted for applied instruction, non-music majors must simultaneously enroll and participate in an ensemble sponsored by the Department of Music. Any student enrolled at The University of Memphis may audition for applied jazz lessons as space permits. Any student accepted for applied jazz lessons must concurrently participate in an appropriate jazz ensemble or combo. Jazz ensemble assignments are made following the jazz auditions during registration week at the beginning of the semester. All jazz and studio bass majors must simultaneously be enrolled in classical bass, MUAP 1541 until a level of proficiency equal to entrance into upper division is attained. All jazz and studio guitar majors must take six semester hours of classical guitar which is the maximum allowable for credit toward the degree. If a student can meet the requirements in less time, and wishes to discontinue classical study, the student may do so with permission of the instructor and consultation with the jazz and studio faculty. In the event a student cannot meet the requirements after six semester hours of study, it is the student's responsibility to pursue classical guitar as an elective or until such time as requirements are met to the satisfaction of the guitar and jazz and studio faculty. FEES: In addition to the regular student fees, all persons taking applied music will be assessed $45.00 per semester for the half-hour lessons. Students registering for one (1) semester hour credit will receive one half-hour lesson per week. All others will receive one hour lesson per week regardless of credit hours at a fee of $90.00. The integration courses-Artist Recital, Senior Composition Recital, Senior Project in Music History, and Senior Performance Project-are taught as applied music, but do not have a fee.

Auditions are held in the Music Building during the pre-college counseling, advising and registration periods before each semester. Auditions may be scheduled in the Music Office, Room 123, Music Building. Any inquiries concerning credits or course numbers should be directed to the chair of the Department of Music. CREDITS AND GRADES: Students may register for one or two hours credit per semester and will be assigned to individual lessons, a master class, or a combination of the two, commensurate with their level APPLIED 12:08:34 PM]of performance. Additional credit may be earned at the lower division and upper division level. Students earning more than two credits per semester will be assigned additional practice and will be expected to perform at a higher level than those students registered for fewer credits. Grades are awarded on the same basis and have the same significance as in other subjects. REPETITION OF COURSES: MUAP courses in individual lessons and major group instruction, small ensembles, and large ensembles may be repeated for credit but not for the purpose of improving the grade originally earned. EXAMINATIONS: For an examination in applied music, students will prepare and perform for members of the faculty of the Department of Music suitable musical selections and technical exercises of a grade of difficulty appropriate to their standing. Examinations are held in designated rooms on days set aside for this purpose near the end of each semester. Credit for the course will not be awarded to any student who fails to take the examination. 1000. Applied Music Workshop. (.5). This course is required of all music majors for eight semesters.

MAJOR GROUP INSTRUCTION: Any student of the university may audition for lessons at the major group level except in organ; organ students must have the ability to play the piano before beginning organ instruction. A student may not receive more than four hours credit in any one area of major group instruction. The fee for major group instruction will be the same as for one half-hour lesson per week: $35.00 per semester. LOWER DIVISION COURSES: Applied music courses in the lower division include the study normally carried out during the freshman and sophomore years. Piano or instrumental students at this level should have had several years of intensive study prior to university entrance so that they have a secure, reliable, and well-grounded technique on the instrument. Organ students may begin at this level provided that they play the piano well and have reasonable ability in sight-reading. Those who do not meet this requirement will register for MUAP 1310. To be admitted to lower division study a student must first pass a qualifying examination. Students who fall short of the requirements for admission to the lower-division courses will be advised to register for major group instruction until deficiencies are eliminated. Course numbers will be repeated for each semester of study. UPPER DIVISION COURSES: Promotion to the upper division does not follow automatically after the completion of four semesters of courses in the lower division but is made only on the recommendation of the upper division examining committee; such a recommendation will be made only if the student's proficiency as a performer bears promise of future artistic and professional qualities as a soloist. It is at this level that the student normally begins preparation for a recital. JUNIOR RECITAL, ARTIST RECITAL, and SENIOR PERFORMANCE PROJECT: The Junior Recital is required for the Performance Concentration under the Bachelor of Music in Music degree. The Artist Recital is required for the Performance Concentration and the Sacred Music Concentration. The Senior Performance Project is required under the School of Music Concentration.
