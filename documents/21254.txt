Mathematical Sciences Majoring in Mathematical Sciences is the first step toward many satisfying and challenging careers. There are two concentrations possible within the major: mathematics or statistics. With a wide variety of courses in mathematics , statistics, and math education available, you will find many ways to construct an individualized curriculum toward your B.S. degree. For students majoring in Chemistry, P hysics, C omputer Science, or Engineering, t here is a 2nd major option in Mathemat ical Sciences designed specifically for you. What opportunities can you enjoy as a member of the University of Memphis Department of Mathematical Sciences? Working with top - flight research faculty, some who currently enjoy major NIH and NSF grants, and others who are part of one of the best research groups in the world in the area of Graph Theory an d Combinatorics. We also have highly - regarded research groups in Partial Differential Equations, Ergodic Theory and Dynamics, Analysis, and Bio - Statistics G etting close guidance from faculty advisors to help you develop a program that meets your needs and goals, and to help you navigate your schedule and requirements prop erly Meeting mathematicians from around the world who visit our campus for our annual Erd ös Lecture Series or for conferences Becoming a member of a successful alumni group, including graduates who went on for advanced degrees at Carnegie - Mellon, Johns Hopkins, the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania , and the U niversit y of M emphis Law School Scholarship opportunities: the Department of Mathematical Sciences offers two scholarships for full - time undergraduates majoring in Math or Statistics.
