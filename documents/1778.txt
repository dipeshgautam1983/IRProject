In contrast to financial accounting information, management accounting information is: • designed and intended for use by managers within the organization, whereas financial accounting information is designed for use by shareholders and cre ditors; • usually confidential and used by management, instead of publicly reported; • forward -looking, instead of historical; !• computed by reference to the needs of managers, often using management information systems , instead of by reference to financial accounting standards .!G%' 1H'I$=&=:'&J"# 1H'I$=&=:'&F !ACCT 2010 – Fundamentals of Accounting I H'I$=%'8!.'K:&!L+68!
