While spam filters block most of these emails, sometimes spam can still make its way into your inbox. It is important to delete these emails because they may contain dangerous malware or viruses. Here are a few safe practices to keep in mind. Block Spammers One of the best ways to reduce the amount of spam you receive is to add senders to your blocked list. Within Outlook you can find the Block or Allows list in Options under the Accounts tab. While this will reduce the amount of spam in your inbox it will not prevent it. Spam senders often use multiple email addresses. Think Before You Share Another great way to help prevent spam is to be careful about where you share your email address. You should only give you main email address out to trusted sources. Also, before you enter your email on any websites, see what boxes are checked before you sign up. Sometimes sites will sign you up to receive email from their partners. You can also use a second email account for things like newsletters and social media. Always try to avoid posting your email address in public. Avoid Malware Never click links or download attachments from untrusted senders. Links and attachments within spam email may contain dangerous malware or viruses. Certain types of malware will target you email address book and send infected emails to other from your account. If your computer has been infected disconnect from the internet and take steps to remove the malware. Click Here for more information about spam.
