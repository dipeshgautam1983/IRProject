Who are we? Since 1990, University of Memphis police officers have been state - certified by the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission (POST). We have 37 full - time, commis- sioned officers. University police officers meet the same employment and training requirements as all other police officers and deputy sheriffs in Tennessee. In addition to police, the University uses contract security on the main campus, Park Ave- nue campus, Millington Center, Carrier Center, the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, and at Lambuth in Jackson, TN. The security officers report to, and maintain communications with, Police Services. What do we do? Police Services is responsible for providing all police/law enforcement services to the Univer- sity community. Our mission is to keep the University of Memphis as a safe place to learn, live and work. Over the last six years, The University of Memphis continuously has one of the lowest incident rates among the ten largest universities in the state. In 2014, the Uni- versity had the lowest rate among Tennessee colleges with campus populations of greater than 5,000 students. Police Services maintains a close working relationship with the Memphis Police Department (MPD) and Jackson Police Department (JPD). While we usually limit our activities to have enforcement powers anywhere in the City of Memphis based on the written mutual assistance agreement in effect with the City of Memphis. Poplar on the north, Goodlett on the east, and Park Avenue on the south, and includes the Park Avenue Campus and its border on Getwell. Officers on the Lambuth Campus in Jack- son, TN also have enforcement powers in the areas around campus based on a written mutual assistance agreement with the JPD. The MPD and JPD are voluntarily notified of most crimes on campus. Both agen- cies are invaluable partners in maintaining a safe University community in Memphis and Jackson. They share data and information with Police Services daily and allow us access to more resources than we could obtain alone. Both agencies share information with Police Services about the surrounding neighborhoods, with a special emphasis on any University - related persons or organizations (Greeks, student religious organizations, et al.) for inclusion in the applicable crime report. In two specific situations, Police Services are required by state law to investigate with the MPD or JPD. First, Police Services maintains the lead in sexual assault investigations, but ond, the applicable municipal agency takes the lead in all death investigations (i.e., unat- With respect to criminal activities students engage in at off - campus locations of registered student organizations, University officers can and do assist with responding to and investi- gating student - consistent with Police Services agreements with the MPD and JPD. If the MPD or JPD are notified about criminal activity occurring off campus involving University students, the MPD or JPD may notify Police Services. However, there is no official MPD or JPD policy requiring such notification. Students in those cases may be subject to arrest and university discipline. In addition, Police Services responds to fires, accidents, medical emergencies, and other cri- sis events. Personnel are trained in first aid/CPR and have AED (Automated External De- fibrillator) units available for cardiac emergencies. Several members of Police Services have been trained as CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) officers and have specialized training for dealing with the mentally ill. Based upon its vision to SET THE STANDARD FOR SERVICE, Police Services is com- mitted to providing professional and quality police and security services to the University community, which includes students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Police Services, as a law enforcement agency, is responsible for reporting crime statistics for each calendar year to the state (Tennessee Bureau of Investigation) and federal government (Department of Justice - Federal Bureau of Investigation). In addition, Police Services is responsible for compiling and publishing the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report as re- quired by the Higher Education Opportunity Act and Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Contact Information University of Memphis Police Services may be contacted at: 100 Zach Curlin Parking Garage Memphis, TN 38152 Telephone: 901 - 678 - 3848 Emergency: 901 - 678 - 4357 Email: police@memphis.edu ANNUAL DISCLOSURE OF CRIME STATISTICS Police Services prepares this report to comply with the Clery Act. The full text of this re- port can be located on our website at securityandsafetymain.pdf . This report is prepared in cooperation with local law enforce- ment agencies surrounding each campus location, Residence Life, and Office of Student Conduct. Each entity provides updated information about their education efforts and pro- grams to comply with the Act. Campus crime, arrest and referral statistics include those reported to Police Services, desig- nated campus officials (including but not limited to directors, deans, department heads, ad- visors to students/student organizations, athletic coaches), and local law enforcement agen- cies. The University offers several ways to report criminal activity while preserving priva- cy. Victims who do not wish to pursue campus disciplinary or criminal action, but who wish to document the details of an incident with the University, may file a report using the Silent Witness program at . REPORTING CRIMES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES The University encourages students, employees, staff, visitors, or any other members of the University community to report all suspicious and/or criminal activity, or any other public safety related emergencies or dangerous situation to Police Services or appropriate law en- forcement agencies in a timely manner. All suspicious and/or criminal activity should be reported to Police Services, which is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Reports can be made in person to a member of the department at the office located in the Zach Curlin Garage (505 Zach Curlin), to any University police officer on patrol, by telephone at 901 - 678 - 4357, by dialing 9 - 1 - 1 (emergencies only), from any emergency phone on campus (blue light phones, red lobby phones, call boxes in elevators and at garage stairwell entrances), by e - mail ( police@memphis.edu ), or anonymously using the Silent Witness program at http:// web0.memphis.edu/police/confidential.php . If victims do not report to Police Services, they are encouraged to contact their local law enforcement agency. A list of all Shelby county police agencies is provided at . At the Lambuth campus in Jackson, TN, reports can be made to the Security office in the Wilder Student Union lower level, the Police office in the Lower Level Carney Johnston, to any officer on patrol, by telephone at 731 - 425 - 1942, from any emergency phone on campus, or by e - mail ( lambuthpolice@memphis.edu) . Links to the Jackson Police and Madison County Sheriff are also found at . As will be discussed in more detail in sections below, sexual misconduct (which encompasses dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault) should be reported to Police Services and/or the Title IX Coordinator at (901) 678 - 2713. TIMELY WARNINGS When Police Services identifies or receives a report of an incident that is a Clery Act crime, a campus wide timely warning will be disseminated when, in the judgment of the Director of Police Services (or his/her designee), the Clery Act crime has occurred within the Universi- the campus, or in or on non - campus buildings or property owned or controlled by the Uni- versity), and the crime constitutes a serious or continuing threat to the campus community. The timely warning will be disseminated in a manner that is timely, does not disclose the name or other identifying information about the victim, and will aid in the prevention of similar crimes. The timely warning will be distributed in a manner reasonably likely to reach the entire campus community, including but not limited to students, faculty, and staff. Depending on the circumstances, any of the following methods, or combination thereof, may be used to disseminate the timely warning: campus - dia, posting to the University of Memphis homepage, activation of the campus outdoor warning system, special information hotline (901 - 678 - 0888), posting of notices, public ad- dress systems mounted on Police Services vehicles, trained residence hall staff, press re- lease, or local news media. Students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to read these alerts as soon as they receive them. If there is an immediate threat of health or safety to students or employees occurring on campus, the University will follow its emergency notification procedures. Campus Security Authorities are instructed to report crimes promptly so that the Universi- ty may determine if a timely warning is warranted. EMERGENCY NOTIFICATI ON Police Services encourages all members of the University community to promptly report emergencies and dangerous situations by calling 901 - 678 - 4357. Upon receiving a report or notification of an emergency situation, Police Services, or the Coordinator of Emergency Preparedness will immediately investigate to confirm a signifi- cant emergency or dangerous situation, usually through Police Services dispatch and/or per- sonnel at the scene. Upon confirmation, Police Services will immediately notify the campus community or the appropriate segments of the community that may be affected by the situ- ation. The President and members of the Executive Council, the Director of Police Services, or their designee, and the Coordinator of Emergency Preparedness have the authority and ability to draft and send emergency communications and initiate the notification system. The University maintains various systems for communicating information quickly to the University community. Some or all of these methods of communication may be activated in the event of an emergency or dangerous situation. These include: An outdoor warning system that can emit tones, pre - recorded digital voice messages, or live voice communication. TigerText, , which can deliver SMS messages to mobile phones, The University Twitter feed, as well as e - mail addresses. Mass e - mail to the University e - mail domain Child Care Center, Residence Life lobbies) Notification of local media outlets Alertus program on all University network computers EMERGENCY RESPONSE A ND EVACUATION PROCEDURES The Clery Act requires the University to have and disclose its emergency response and evac- uation procedures, which the University will implement in response to any significant emer- gency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat of the health or safety of stu- dents or employees on campus. The University has an emergency response plan that includes procedures for a campus - wide evacuation in the event of a major disaster or emergency. The Office of Emergency Man- agement, is responsible for developing and implementing pro- grams and projects in emergency planning, training, response, and recovery. The Office of Emergency Preparedness schedules drills, tests, and exercises internally and with outside agencies (Memphis/Shelby County EMA, et al) to evaluate the procedures and response plans. Some activities occur monthly, such as testing the outdoor warning system, while larger scale tests and exercises occur less frequently (e.g. annually, bi - annually). The Uni- versity conducts evacuation drills regularly in all university buildings for the purpose of preparing building occupants for an organized evacuation in the case of an emergency evac- u a t i o n . When the University determines that a building or an area of the University must be evacu- ated, individuals should evacuate the building in accordance with established emergency response plans. Should an emergency occur and there is no notification, either by alarm or by someone in authority, an individual who feels the need to evacuate should relocate them- selves in accordance with procedures contained in the emergency plan for the building or structure in which they inhabit. This does not mean that individuals should go home. They should assemble in the designated evacuation assembly area and wait for further instruction from designated emergency personnel. Individuals should not return to the building until instructed to do so by authorized personnel. When asked to evacuate a building or an area of the University, the following should be taken into consideration: Remain calm. Immediately proceed to the nearest emergency exit and get out of the building. Be alert to broken glass, particularly in the lobbies. As you evacuate, check for other employees, students or visitors who may be disoriented and assist them in exiting. Take only your keys, purse or emergency supplies that you need. Do not attempt to take large or valuable objects that might slow your progress. Shut (but do not lock) doors behind you as you exit. Floor wardens should lock the building or monitor any open entrances if it does not jeopardize their own safety. Do not use elevators. In emergency stairwells, stay to the right side and use the handrails. Remove high - heeled shoes, if possible. Floor wardens for each department should ensure that all members of their department evacuate the building, and that they are accounted for at the Assembly Area. If it is determined that employees, students or visitors remain inside the building, this information should be conveyed to responding emergency workers. Rescue teams may be sent in only if it is deemed to be safe to proceed. Do not re - enter the building until emergency personnel announce that it is safe. SECURITY OF AND ACCESS TO CAMPUS FACILITIES The campus and facilities of the University are restricted to students, faculty, staff, guests, and invitees of the University, except when all or part of the campus, its build- ings or facilities are open to the general public for a designated time and purpose. Individu- als loitering without a legitimate purpose may be issued trespass warnings and directed to leave campus. Failure to comply with the warning or returning without prior permission or clearance of the trespass warning may result in arrest. The main lobbies of residence halls are open from 7:00 a.m. to midnight each day. After midnight, the residence hall lobbies are restricted to student residents and authorized staff. Visitation hours are established by a two - thirds majority of the residents of each hall at the beginning of the Fall semester. Visitation hours may not exceed 12 hours (Noon to Mid- night) on weekdays and 14 hours (Noon to 2:00 a.m.) on weekends. For more information concerning residence halls consult Residence Life at . Some buildings and residence halls require a valid card swipe or key fob for entry, http:// policies.memphis.edu/UM1567.htm . All non - residence hall hours are set by the staff as- signed to the building or by the functions scheduled (e.g., classes). Doors not on an auto- mated system are manually locked and unlocked for business hours by Police Services. Police Services can open doors by request from authorized faculty and staff, or admit per- sons approved by a department head or instructor ( bldgaccess.pdf ). Police Services should be notified whenever an activity has concluded and the responsible party lacks the means to secure the space. Any maintenance problem with doors should be reported to Physical Plant, 901 - 678 - 2699, or workrequest.php . Police Services, Physical Plant, Campus Planning, Information Technology, and the Crimi- nology and Criminal Justice Department conduct surveys of campus facilities and the sur- rounding community using Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles. Everything from landscaping to lighting is examined to maximize proven safety principles. When new buildings are being planned, or older buildings are to be remodeled, safety and security are incorporated into the design phase. In addition, during the Fall se- mester, lighting surveys are completed with representatives of the Student Government Association, Police Services, Physical Plant, Campus Planning, and Residence Life. The University has installed over 700 web - based cameras across the institution. These units following a crime, an accident, or a natural disaster. SECURITY AWARENESS Police Services, in conjunction with the Division of Student Affairs, sponsors ongoing pro- gramming on crime prevention and safety awareness for students, faculty, and staff. Pro- gramming includes skits, videos, self - defense presentations, and discussions presented to various student organizations and groups, resident students, and new students during ori- entation and freshmen ACAD classes. Police Services, along with Human Resources, ad- dresses faculty and staff in employee orientation, Human Resources sponsored training, and training through the individual work stations and departments. Several brochures are available on the web at , and others, such as the Student Handbook, are printed and distributed through various outlets. All students are encouraged to read and understand the Code of Student Rights and Responsi- bilities, . These efforts encourage all students, faculty, staff, visitors and guests to adopt safe behaviors and foster a sense of per- sonal responsibility for safety. ALCOHOL AND ILLEGAL DRUGS In accordance with local, state and federal law, the University of Memphis students and em- ployees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensa- tion, possession, use or being under the influence of controlled substances (illicit drugs) and/ or alcohol on the University Campus or on property owned or controlled by the University or as part of any of the University's activities. All students and employees are subject to applicable laws related to this matter, and any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including expulsion or termination of employment with the University and referral for prosecution or mandato- ry participation in a drug or alcohol abuse assistance or rehabilitation program ( http:// policies.memphis.edu/UM1563.htm ). In addition, possession of drugs or alcohol in the Resi- dence Halls may result in cancellation of the housing contract and forfeiture of any fees. A variety of resources are available to students who wish to obtain assistance or information concerning use/abuse of drugs and/or alcohol. The University encourages the use of confi- dential resources such as the Psychological Counseling Unit (students only), 901 - 678 - 2068; Employee Assistance Program (employees only), 1 - 800 - 308 - 4934; and Alcoholics Anony- mous, 901 - 454 - 1414.

University personnel will assist victims in noti- fying the below listed authorities if the victim so requests. Victims also have the option to decline to notify law enforcement. Any individual can report a crime of sexual miscon- duct to the University Police (Phone Number: 901 - 678 - 3848; Emergency Line: 901 - 678 - 3848; Jackson Campus: 731 - 425 - 1942) or the Memphis Police (9 - 1 - 1). A police report can be filed at any time, though evidence is likely to be stronger the sooner a report is filed after the incident. If a victim chooses not to make a complaint regarding an incident, they should nevertheless consider speaking with the Uni- versity Police or other law enforcement to preserve evidence in the event they later decide to file charges. Filing a police report does not necessarily mean that further legal action must be taken.

MISSING STUDENT NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES Overview The purpose of this policy is to establish policies and procedures, in compliance with Higher Education Act of 2008, for the University of Memphis community regarding the reporting, investigation, and required emergency notification of any residential student of the Univer- sity who, based on the facts and circumstances known to the University, has been deter- mined to be missing for 24 hours or more. This policy only applies to residential students. For the purpose of this policy, a residential student is a currently enrolled student who resides in University - owned, on - campus student housing under a housing contract. All reports on students suspected to be missing for 24 hours or more should be directed to Police Services at 901 - 678 - 4357. It is the responsibility of all members of the academic community, including students, faculty, and staff, to report to Police Services when they believe that a student is missing. Notification of this policy will be made directly to all students residing in on - campus hous- Identification of Emergency Contacts All University students applying for on - campus housing will have the option, in addition to providing an emergency contact, of identifying one or more individuals to be contacted by the University within 24 hours of a determination that the student is missing in accordance with this policy. The missing person contact information will be registered confidentially, and will not be disclosed externally except to authorized campus officials, including Uni- versity police, and law enforcement agencies in furtherance of a missing person investiga- tion. If a residential student is under 18 years of age and not an emancipated minor, the Univer- sity is required to notify a custodial parent or guardian within 24 hours of the determina- tion that the student is missing, in addition to notifying any other contact person designat- ed by the student. All missing person contact information will be maintained by Residence Life and Dining mation at any time by notifying Residence Life at reslife@memphis.edu or 901 - 678 - 5219. Procedures for Reporting Missing Students Students, employees, staff, or any other members of the University community who have reason to believe that a residential student is missing should immediately notify the Uni- versity Police at 901 - 678 - 4357. The University Police will generate a missing person report and initiate an investigation. Individuals may report a residential student missing at any time; there is no requirement for the individual to wait until he or she believes the residential student has been missing for 24 hours. Investigating a Missing Student Report Upon receipt of a report of a possible missing residential student, Police Services will imme- diately initiate a missing person investigation. A residential student is determined to be missing when the University police have verified that the reported information is credible and the circumstances warrant declaring the student missing. Should the University police determine that a residential student has been missing for 24 hours or more, Residence Life will be notified to verify the students appropriate missing person contact information. Police Services will then notify the following individuals no later than 24 hours after the student is determined to be missing: 1. son contact, if one has been provided, and the Memphis Police Department, Jackson Police Department, or other appropriate law enforcement agencies. 2. If the student is under 18 years old and emancipated, Police Services will notify the stu- partment, Jackson Police Department, or other appropriate law enforcement agencies. 3. If the student is under 18 years of age and not emancipated, Police Services will notify well as the Memphis Police Department, Jackson Police Department, or other appropri- ate law enforcement agencies. If the student is not a residential student, Police Services will make a determination if addi- tional action is needed. Nothing in this policy restricts the University from making notifications earlier than noted above if deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Nothing in this policy restricts the University from contacting other individuals if deemed necessary to prevent harm to a stu- dent or others, necessary to the investigation, or otherwise appropriate under the circum- stances. Regardless of whether the student who has identified a missing person contact is above the age of 18, or is an emancipated minor, Police Services will inform the Memphis Police De- partment, the Jackson Police department, or other appropriate law enforcement agencies within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing. The law enforcement agency, however, will not be notified if the law enforcement agency was the entity that made the determination that the student was missing. The determination of whether a student is emancipated will be based on the information available at the time the contact is required.

The University of Memphis complies with all fire regulations vices at 901 - 678 - 4357 or at Lambuth call 731 - 425 - 1942. A log is maintained at Police Ser- vices of all fires and can be viewed during normal business hours (Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.). FIRE SAFETY EQUIPMEN T Richardson Towers, Rawls Hall, Smith Hall, Mynders Hall, South Hall, and the LLC (Living Learning Center) have sprinkler systems with monitored smoke detection systems that report to a central alarm panel. The townhouses on the western end the Carpenter Complex (sorority row) also have sprin- klers and monitored smoke detection. The townhouses on the north side of Carpenter (along Poplar Avenue) have localized smoke detection only. The remainder of Carpenter Complex has localized smoke detection and centrally monitored pull stations in each apart- ment. Park Avenue student family housing has localized smoke detection. At Lambuth, Carney Johnston Hall has sprinklers and monitored smoke detectors. EDUCATION, TRAINING AND DRILLS Employee Safety and Health (ESH) schedules fire drills and evacuations twice a semester at student housing facilities. Residence Life staff receives training on fires and evacuation from ESH. This training includes the use of a fire extinguisher simulator. In addition, Physical Plant offers Community Emergency Response Training (CERT) to students and employees, which includes fire safety and training with the fire extinguisher simulator. FIRE ALARM EVACUATIO N PROCEDURE When the fire alarm is heard, leave the building via the nearest exit and travel a safe dis- tance from the building. DO NOT USE ELEVATORS! EVERY ALARM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A POTENTIAL FIRE! Assist all persons with impaired mobility to the nearest illuminated exit or stairwell to await rescue by trained personnel. Faculty and Staff should notify Police Services of any known student or visitor with impaired mobility who is unable to independently exit the building. Department Chairs and Directors of Activities are responsible for having a plan to account for employees and to notify Police Services of those missing who may be trapped in the building. State and local regulations require all occupants to leave the building if a fire alarm occurs. Before a fire occurs, there are some simple steps you can follow that will aid your survival. Find the nearest exit and also an alternate exit, should the primary one be blocked. Ensure that the path out is clear of any obstructions and that all doors leading out of the building can be opened. Find the nearest fire extinguisher and learn how to use it if necessary. IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE : 1. Rescue any person in immediate danger. 2. Sound the fire alarm. Pull stations are near each exit on each floor. 3. Call Police Services at 901 - 678 - 4357 or 911. They will initiate a conference call with you and the Memphis Fire Department. Stay on the phone until the Fire Department and Police Services obtain all information. At Lambuth, call 731 - 425 - 1942 or 911. 4. When the fire alarm sounds, evacuate the building immediately using the nearest exit. As you exit, close as many doors as possible between you and the fire. Move a safe dis- tance away from the building (at least 50 feet). 5. Before opening any door, feel it with the back of your hand. If it is hot, do not open it! If it is not hot, open cautiously, bracing yourself against it to slam it shut if you feel a rush of heat. 6. If the closest exit is blocked, go to an alternative exit. If all doors are blocked, exit through a ground floor window, but watch for broken glass. IF YOU BECOME TRAPPED BY THE FIRE : 1. Stay calm; fire fighters are on the way. 2. Move as far away from the fire as you can, closing every door between you and the fire. 3. Hang or wave an object from a window or outside the door to attract the attention of rescuers. 4. If smoke enters under the door or around vents, stuff the opening with towels, drapes, or anything available. Soak them with water if possible. 5. Crack open the window at the top to let heat and smoke out and at the bottom to let in fresh air. Stay as close to the floor as possible. Crawl if necessary. IF YOU DECIDE TO FIGHT THE FIRE : 1. Do not let the fire get between you and the exit. 2. Avoid breathing smoke or fire gases. 3. Use the proper fire extinguisher. Do not use water on an electrical fire. Pull the pin. Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire. Squeeze the handle. Sweep from side to side. Leave the area if the fire increases in intensity.
