Each area is grounded by an overarching mission to use law and policy to advance health. Educational goals focus on developing competencies and skills in law students for interdisciplinary, client- and mission-driven practice via traditional coursework, externships and other skills-based opportunities, and scholarship. Focus areas cover traditional health law practice, as well as public health and health system policy and science/biotechnology. Faculty have expertise in a diverse array of health law fields, and are also drawn from the surrounding community – who bring a critical practice-based orientation to education. Scholarship opportunities open up for students the possibility for self-directed and faculty-sponsored research, both within and transcending the law school's boundaries, to include, for example, collaboration with affiliated faculty with the School of Public Health and the School of Nursing at the University of Memphis, and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Service extends iHeLP's reach into the community, where the Institute endeavors to: address unmet health law issues of local organizations and communities, host community forums on health law and policy issues, and work with community leaders to proactively address health policy needs. Health Law is constantly changing on the national, state, and local scale. Stay up to date with the latest events, information and announcements by connecting with us on social media. Like us!
