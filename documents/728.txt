As we move toward an inauguration this spring, I would like to focus on that relationship, providing an opportunity for us to give back to the city of Memphis with a year of service . The University of Memphis is already engaged in a broad range of important and impactful efforts with the Memphis community. This year will allow an opportunity to expand those efforts, celebrate their enduring success, and be thoughtful in planning our future together. We will recognize and celebrate the hard work of our faculty, students, staff and alumni at this spring’s inaugural event. I would like to challenge our campus community, student organizations and alumni to identify and engage in service projects in Memphis, Jackson and the surrounding communities this year. This spring’s inaugural event will celebrate our many partnerships with Memphis and the mid-south and recognize the breadth and depth of our relationships. The goal is 500,000 combined hours of service before the end of the spring semester. The planning committees are just now getting to work. We’ll keep you updated as the schedule is completed. I look forward to an exciting year, one characterized by a year of service.   To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.
