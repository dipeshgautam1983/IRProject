Earning credit for the work you do! University of Memphis grants Experiential Learning Credit (ELC) to students who demonstrate the academic merit of such experiences. Experiential learning is learning by doing. An ELC award will save money and accelerate degree completion. The UofM Finish Line Program targets students who previously attended the University of Memphis and have completed 90 or more credit hours but have regrettably had to abandon their dreams of completing a college degree. Many have demonstrated the ability to be successful in college and are within a single academic year of successful graduation (i.e. 30 hours). Yet the primary reason for withdrawal at 90+ hours is exhausted financial aid and related external situations, such as needing to work full -time to support a family.
