Film &amp; Video Production Concentration The concentration in Film and Video production combines technical instruction with courses in both motion picture and traditional communication studies to provide students with the knowledge and tools necessary to function in the multifaceted world of audiovisual production. The approach to media practice is broad enough to address the needs of the independent artist, as well as those who seek to enter the industry. See what FVP Communication MA alumni are doing. PROGRAM BASICS Upon admission to the Master's program, students are advised by the Graduate Studies Coordinator until they choose a major advisor, convene a committee, and submit a Plan of Study for approval. Students work closely with their advisory committee to form a plan appropriate to the student's scholarly goals. The plan spells out the student's area of research and creative emphasis, lists the courses that s/he will take, and offers a timetable for completing the MA. Students in the general Communication concentration must complete at least 30 hours of coursework (10 classes) for the MA. If in lieu of a thesis the student elects to complete the degree by taking comprehensive exams, the degree requires at least 33 hours (11 classes) of coursework. The Film and Video production concentration requires all students to complete a culminating project. Full-time students typically spend about two years to earn the MA. Obviously, this varies depending on the student's success in moving through each stage of the program.
