If so, the University of Memphis's Master of Science (M.S.) in Leadership and Policy Studies with a concentration in Student Personnel may be for you. The program emphasizes the skills, knowledge, and attitudes required to be effective leaders on college campuses. The concentration in Student Personnel is designed for those who are enthusiastic about working with college students in various functional areas, including but not limited to housing, admissions, student life, orientation, academic advising and judicial affairs. Students are able to tailor the program to fit individual goals and interests. Opportunities for practical experience are available through internships and graduate assistantships. Students are also encouraged to continue their professional preparation at the doctoral level. The Program of Studies provides an overview of required coursework for completion of the degree. Most students in our program have already established successful careers. Therefore, classes are scheduled in the evenings and on weekends to meet the needs of the working adult. Prior to graduation, students are required to produce a portfolio of the products created in the courses which demonstrate specific program competencies.
