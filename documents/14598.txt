What’s a flipped classroom — and why now? Created by Knewton and Column Five Media Posted in Facutly Resources Podcast Central Posted on December 9, 2014 by dhrdaway@memphis.edu In Fall 2007, Podcast Central was implemented as the University’s online hosting service for audio and video files. As we continue to grow and enhance our services, we are limiting the scope of Podcast Central. Effective, December 23, 2014, access to Podcast Central will be “Read-Only”.  Depending on the size and purpose of your presentations, media content will be uploaded exclusively using one of our umMedia Services (currently Ensemble and Mediasite).  A survey has been added to the  umMedia  page which will help determine which program will best meet your needs. Please submit the completed survey, and a member of the ITS Center for Teaching &amp; Learning staff will contact you for a consultation. Meanwhile, we ask that you purge Podcast recordings that are no longer needed as we prepare for this transition. For questions or more information, you may contact the Service Desk at 678-8888 or visit the website at .
