Student Giving Donate Now Senior Class Gift Common Cents Philanthropy Council Home Student Giving Common Cents It just takes a few "CENTS" to benefit the "COMMON" good of all students at the University of Memphis. The Common Cents Philanthropy Council is a student organization of dedicated students at the University of Memphis committed to raising awareness of philanthropy and giving among UofM students. The Council has a goal to teach peers about the benefits of philanthropy, collect funds for student-centered campus projects, helping fundraise for the Senior Class Gift and inspire students to make an impact at the UofM. We also serve as a student development board, assisting the Office of Annual Giving in raising awareness about the impact of private giving at The University of Memphis. Council members get a first-hand look at fundraising operations for the University and work actively with the Development team on marketing campaigns, events and other activities.
