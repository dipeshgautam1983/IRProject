The Department of Leadership HIAD LDPS Faculty Home LEAD facultyprofiles Jeff Wilson Dr. Jeffrey Wilson Associate Professor Phone (901) 678-3428 Email jlwlson4@memphis.edu Fax Office Browning, 313 Office Hours About Dr. Wilson For the past seven years, Dr. Jeffery Wilson has been a faculty member in the Leadership Department's Higher and Adult Education Program at the University of Memphis. He completed his doctoral studies in Higher Educational Leadership at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, received his masters degree in Student Affairs Administration at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and did his undergrad at Virginia Commonwealth University. His areas of research interest are college student affairs and diversity, specifically leadership for diversity and campus climate. Prior to coming to Memphis, Dr. Wilson worked in student affairs and enrollment services and was a visiting assistant professor. Dr. Wilson enjoys the academic side of higher education. Having worked in both settings, he understands the demands of the former and the culture of the latter and brings those insights to any endeavor on which he embarks. Dr. Wilson has an ambitious research agenda that is focused on diversity as it relates to multicultural education, leadership, and institutional culture and climate. Already, he has had several works to appear in the Journal of Diversity in Higher Education, the Journal of College Student Development, and Innovative Higher Education to name a few. His service includes membership to the editorial board of the Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice, and the National Advisory Committee for the National Conference on Race &amp; Ethnicity in American Higher Education (NCORE). Recently, Dr. Wilson was awarded the Tennessee Board of Regent's Maxine Smith Fellowship. Dr. Wilson intends to continue building on his quest to be a diversity scholar while at the University of Memphis and looks forward to seeing more of his students graduate from the program and begin their own higher education pursuits.
