Department of Physics and Materials Science About Undergraduate Graduate People Research Resources SPS About About the Department Chair's Message Home Department of Physics and Materials Science About Chair's Message Chair's Message Welcome to the Department of Physics at The University of Memphis! Our goal is to advance scientific knowledge and innovation while at the same time educating the next generation of talented scientists. Our dedicated faculty supports this mission with cutting-edge research, unique programs, and a supportive learning environment. We offer exciting B.S. and M.S. programs in general physics and materials science. The moderate size of our department allows our faculty to work with students one-on-one to meet the individual needs and interests of each student. Our students have excellent working relationships with faculty in a training atmosphere that is often difficult to attain at larger institutions. Our faculty conducts advanced research in Nanotechnology, Nanomaterials, Energy Materials, Space Materials, Biomaterials, Nano- and Bio-Photonics, Computational and Theoretical Physics, Astrophysics, and Physics Education. These forefront research projects and our state-of-the-art facilities provide unique research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. We consider undergraduate research experience as a vital part in the education of our physics majors. Our undergraduate students may participate in research as early as their freshman year. I invite you to further explore our department, and hope you consider joining us on our beautiful campus. If you have any questions or want to schedule a visit, please do not hesitate to contact me.
