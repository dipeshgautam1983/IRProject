IV. PhD Program The goal of the Ph.D. concentration in Accounting is to develop the next generation of committed scholars and excellent teachers by providing an active and stimulating intellectual environment. The Accounting Ph.D. program prepares doctoral students for research-oriented academic positions at well-regarded universities and colleges that demand solid teaching skills. We train doctoral students in classroom management and the development of solid teaching skills. Research in the School of Accountancy focuses on economic based issues of importance to the accounting and business community such as the impact of accounting information on capital market participants as well as other firm stakeholders. Reflecting the research orientation of the faculty, development of research and academic writing skills is continually emphasized throughout the Ph.D. program. The faculty goal for matriculation is four years. In seminars, doctoral students are encouraged to start working on the framework for the dissertation early in the first year aligned with research experts in the field. In the first two years, students focus on their coursework, are involved in a research workshop, and work closely with faculty on a research project. Students take their comprehensive examinations at the beginning of the third year. In their third and fourth years of study, students develop and present their thesis proposal, then complete and defend the dissertation. A major strength of the Ph.D. program in accounting is that its graduate faculty members are student-oriented. Research with faculty is encouraged and fostered in a highly collegial environment. We emphasize a close faculty-doctoral student interaction. Only a few students are admitted into the doctoral program each year and they are encouraged to work closely as a team cohort. Doctoral students are involved in all phases of faculty research, including co-authorship of research papers and presentations at professional meetings. Most of the current doctoral students are CPAs with business experience at the most prestigious corporate accounting and public accounting firms. Our graduate faculty members have published books and received academic honors that include chaired professorships. The accounting faculty publish their research in the top tiered accounting journals such as The Accounting Review, Contemporary Accounting, Research, Journal of Accounting and Economics as well as the highly regarded journals of the American Accounting Association in sub-discipline fields, among others.
