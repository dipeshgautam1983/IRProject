The '*' wildcard may also be embedded in a search string. You may use '?' to replace a single character anywhere within a word. Examples : environment* polic*, wom?n Boolean Operators Use "and" or "or" to specify multiple words in any field, any order. Use "and not" to exclude words. Example : rhythm and blues Example : (tennessee or mississippi) and (adventure and not vacation) Field limits A field limit causes the system to search only the specified field for the specified word(s). Grouping Keyword search results are usually grouped by relevance to bring the most likely titles to the top of the list. Each group represents a similar level of relevance and results are sorted within the group by date or title. To get an ungrouped result set, use boolean operators to form a complex query.
