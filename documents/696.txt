We understand diversity as the intersection of multiple factors including age, class, color, culture, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, immigration status, national origin, political ideology, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We make a concerted and deliberate effort to include a diverse student body and faculty across all axes of difference. We endeavor to create a welcoming environment of inclusiveness and respect for difference not only in background and demographics, but in point of view and opinion.
