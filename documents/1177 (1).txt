Program in Biology This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Science in Biology during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.S./M.S. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Biological Sciences. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.S. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.S. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Biology department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in biology. Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.S./M.S. program, which allows them to take graduate courses in biology. To continue in the program past the B.S., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the Biological Sciences department's M.S. program. Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply to undergraduate GPA.
