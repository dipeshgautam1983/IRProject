Department of Theatre &amp; Dance About Academic Programs Admissions People Production Archives Home Theatre &amp; Dance Archives Love in a Time of War LOVE IN A TIME OF WAR By Catherine Ladnier and Paul Janensch October 11-16, 2010 at 7:30 p.m. Directed by Leslie Barker PHOTOS Love and war are surely a powerful narrative in this new romance based on the real life letters sent across the world during World War II 65 years ago. Ordinary men and women meet extraordinary challenges during the World War II era. The men are facing the draft or are in uniform. Some see action. The women are lonely and dealing with shortages. Their letters are candid, sad and funny. The common theme is a longing for the loved one. The letters were saved by Eva Lee Brown of Easley, SC and discovered more than 50 years later by her daughter Catherine Ladnier. Join us Monday, October 11 at 6 p.m. in the Lab Theatre (TC-235) for a discussion with Catherine Ladnier followed by a reception.
