The lab, directed by Dr. Kristoffer Berlin, is a part of the Child and Family Research Area and the Clinical Psychology program. Current or prospective graduate students should feel free to contact Dr. Berlin directly. Undergraduate students interested in gaining research experience in the CHILL Lab should complete this Research Assistant Information Sheet and email it to Dr. Berlin at ksberlin@memphis.edu Research Assistant Information Sheet Research Focus The Child Health and Illness Lab conducts research spanning the fields of pediatric psychology, child-clinical, clinical health psychology, and quantitative psychology. Most broadly, this research focuses on cultural, family, and behavioral factors that promote health and reduce morbidity in childhood chronic illness. More specifically, this research hopes to: Identify the influence of cultural and family factors on children's weight, diet, and mealtime behavior, with a particular focus on obesity in early childhood. Examine models of stress and adaptation to promote quality of life and regimen adherence among youth with Type 1 diabetes and their families Integrate quantitative and behavioral methodologies to inform, develop, and refine clinical health interventions and assessment to reduce and eliminate health disparities. Information Click below to expand topic. &gt;Current Projects PRYDE Study The PRYDE study (Predicting Resiliency in Youth with Type 1 DiabEtes) is a collaboration with LeBonheur Children's Hospital Diabetes Clinic. This on-going longitudinal study began in the spring of 2013, with the purpose of identifying longitudinal predictors of adherence and glycemic control based on diabetes-specific social information processing and acceptance-based coping models that may decrease health disparities. Predictors of Accelerated Weight Gain in Urban Infants and Toddlers In collaboration with the Urban Child Institute's CANDLE study, we are currently engaged in a project titled Predictors of Accelerated Weight Gain in Urban Infants and Toddlers. We are utilizing the data collected in the CANDLE study to determine the influence of race, income, child gender, and maternal factors on urban children's birth adiposity and change in adiposity over the course of the study. In addition, we are investigating whether differential weight trajectories exist among urban infants and toddlers and predictors of those trajectories. Growth and Resilience, In-the-midst of Type 1 diabetes (GRIT) Type-1 diabetes (T1D) in childhood is a prevalent and costly disorder associated with substantial morbidity that differentially impacts low-income and minority youth and their families. Given the increased risk for life-threatening consequences of suboptimal glycemic control and evidence of only modest treatment efficacy in general, the objective of this study is to develop a culturally tailored acceptance-based behavioral intervention to improve glycemic control and quality of life among low income adolescents with Type-1 diabetes and their families. Youth and Maternal Mealtime Interaction Study (YuMMi Study) The Youth and Maternal Mealtime Interactions Study will explore the reciprocal dyadic interactions that influence eating, mealtime behavior, and children’s weight and growth. YuMMI is a collaboration between the University of Memphis and the University of Michigan that will code both laboratory and home-based family mealtime interactions. &gt;Lab Members Kristoffer S. Berlin, Ph.D. Dr. Berlin is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology in the Department of Psychology at the University of Memphis and the Director of the CHILL Lab. He received his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and completed his internship and postdoctoral fellowship at Brown University. He has broad research interests in the fields of pediatric psychology, child clinical psychology, and quantitative psychology. His program of research focuses on cultural, family, and behavioral factors that promote health and reduce morbidity and health disparities in childhood chronic illness. He is also a licensed clinical psychologist with health service provider designation in the state of Tennessee. Gabrielle Banks, B.A. Gabrielle is a third year student in the Clinical Psychology doctoral program at the University of Memphis. She received her bachelor of arts degree in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. Her broad research interests include social and emotional influences on children coping with pediatric chronic illness. Tiffany Rybak, B.A. Tiffany is a third year Clinical Ph.D. student. She received her bachelor of arts degree in Psychology from Ohio University. Her current research seeks to understand what contributes to children’s risk for obesity early on in life (i.e., from infancy through early childhood). Specifically, Tiffany is interested in how a variety of factors related to culture, family, and individual behaviors either promote healthy growth or increase risk for adiposity. She has witnessed value in taking a person-centered analytical approach when examining a complex issue, such as pediatric obesity. Implementing advanced quantitative methodologies in this field of research will inform and strengthen our intervention and prevention efforts. She hopes to help translate our research into effective intervention and prevention programs that are culturally and individually tailored. Jeanelle Ali, M.Sc. Jeanelle is a third year student in Clinical Psychology program at the University of Memphis. She earned her master of science degree in Clinical Psychology from the University of the West Indies.

She received her bachelor of science degree in Psychology and Biology from Loyola University, Chicago. Her current research interests include health related quality of life, adherence, psychological adjustment, and social functioning in youth with chronic health conditions.
