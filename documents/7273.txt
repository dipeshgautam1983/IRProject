This enables you to reuse questions in various quizzes, surveys, and self assessments. Do one of the following: On the Manage Quizzes page, click Question Library from the tool navigation. Questions in the Question Library are shared between Self Assessments, Quizzes, and Surveys. While editing or creating a quiz, click Add/Edit Questions in the Properties tab. In the Question Library or the Add/Edit Questions area of the Quizzes tool, select the question type or information item you want to create from the New button. Quiz feedback and hints All quiz question types allow you to include Feedback and Hints. Feedback enables you to provide added information as a basis for improving content comprehension. Hints are useful for suggesting how to approach a question. You can provide feedback comments at the end of a question such as what details instructors are looking for in an ideal response.
