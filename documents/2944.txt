NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 4 Exploring a Career in Law A J.D., Juris Doctor, can lead to a wide range of law - related careers and can open doors to careers in government, business, higher education, communicatio ns, and numerous other fields. Law schoo l graduates are administrators, teachers, librarians, and business managers as well as advocates, judges, and politicians. Law can be a rewarding profession. At its best, legal practice challenges the intellect, demanding the ex ercise of reason and judgment. The et hics of the profession require attorneys to promote justice, fairness, and morality; thus, legal employment can bring particular satisfaction to those who aspire to work within the law to seek social justice. Exploring Your Interest ******************** ************************************* Before beginning the application process, consider carefully if a law degree is right for you. It is not necessary to know what kind of law you want to practice , or e ven if you want to practice law, to decide to attend law school. There are a number of ways you can explore the field of law: Email the Pre - Professional Advisor to be added to th e mailing list to stay informed of law - related programs and opportunities. Become an active member of the Pre - Law Society. Ta lk with the Pre - Professional Advisor about your interest in pursuing legal studies. Conduct research on legal careers using resources available through Career Services and/or The Career and Psychological Counseling Center. Investigate online resources that provide information on legal careers, law school , employment statistics, and other law - related topics. Intern with a law firm or law - related organization to gain exposure to the field and to experience the work environment. Take a tour of The Unive rsity of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law and speak with a law student ambassador about the law school experience. Contact the Law Admissions Office at 901 - 678 - 5403 to schedule a tour. Conduct information interviews to le arn about the legal profe ssion. Discuss what lawyers do in a typical work day , personal attributes needed to be successful in a legal career , and sat isfactions and dissatisfactions of the field . NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 5 R ealities of a Legal Career ******************************************************** * An important step in making a decision is to distinguish between commonly held expectations and the reality of legal practice. Hours can be very lo ng and often include weekends. Legal work can require spending considerable time in tedious, painst aking re search. Depending on the type of law practiced and the location, entry into law firms can be difficult and salar ies may not meet expectations. The market for new lawyers is competitive for those seeking positions in cities and firms that are in high demand . Employment statistics for the class of 20 13 law graduates based on responses from 44,637 ( close to 9 6 % of all graduates) reveal the following 1 : 66.5% of graduates remained in - state for employment. The average starting salary was $ 82,408 ; the median s alary was $ 62,467 . Approximately 51.1 % of the class chose private practice in law firms. About 28 % took positions in public service, including judicial clerkships, g overnment agencies , and public interest organizations. Graduates entering business accou nted for 18.4 %. While a corporate lawyer in a private firm may earn $ 10 0,000 + the first year, he or she may also work twelve hours a day, six or seven days a week. For those graduates pursuing public interest law, the median starting salary is around $4 5 , 000. There are significant differences in career choices lawyers make, from public interest law and government law to private practice in a firm. The range in starting salaries alone can exceed $100,000. Career choices of new graduates are also likely to be influenced by the amount of debt most law students accumulate while pursuing their J.D. 1 NALP Recent Graduates Class of 2013 ; National Summary Chart for Class of 2013 NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 6 Preparing for Law School L aw schools are interested in your ability to do rigorous analytical research, to write well , to present, and to persuade . Therefore, students should choose a variety of courses that develop and enhance these skills. The American Bar Association offers an o verview of the skills and values important to preparing for a legal education and a career in law. Choosing a Major ********************************************************* - ar Association (ABA) requires law school applicants to have completed an undergraduate degree, it does not require any one major in particular nor does it specify particular prerequisite courses for admission. Many - major in what are cons idered traditional majors for admission to law school, such as history, philosophy, political science, and English, but it is becoming increasingly common for students to major in a variety of other fields and seek (and gain!) admission to law school. U ltimately it is up to you ! C hoose a major you are interested in and then do well in that major while taking advantage of opportunities to develop strong research, writing, critical thinking, and communication skills. Regardless of the major, students admit ted to law school excel academically, score competitively on the LSAT, and are overall well - rounded applicants. For a complete listing of undergraduate programs at The University of Memphis visit: - degrees.php . You will be advised in the department that houses your major but should contact t he Pre - Professional Advisor to be added to the pre - law mailing list. You are encouraged to meet with the Pre - Professional Advisor at least once a year. Compile an Impressive Record ********************************************************* A solid GPA , particularly within your major, is expected, but a willingness to go beyond requirements demonstra tes an intellectual curiosity that would be adv antageous in the study of law. Academic excellence reflects discipline and abilities, though the variety and depth of your coursework will also be seriously considered by admissions committees as evidence of y our interests and motivation. In general, lecture courses provide a good foundation for further instruction, while seminars allow you to present, discuss, critique, and defend more specific ideas. Smaller classes give you the opportuni ty to interact with faculty. Get to know faculty whom you might later ask for recommendations; make yourself stand out as an individua l by attending office hours and asking questions in class . NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 7 Planning Your Schedule ********************************************************* It is understandable that you have more going on in your life than just attending class. Many student s balance family and work responsibilities with homework, time in class, and student involvement. In addition, as a pre - law student, you may be gaining ex perience through volunteering, internships, and leadership roles in student organizations . Keep in mind, however , that there is no substitute for good grades when applying to law school. Withdrawing/Repeating Courses ************************************* ******************** Most law schools take into account all grades earned at the undergraduate level, including any repeated courses. This means that law schools will consider both your old grade and new grade in your overall GPA calculation. You should al so avoid withdrawing from a course after the first week of class when possible. A pattern of withdrawals and repeated courses may end up costing you in terms of time, money, and lost opportunities. Student involvement, volunteering, work, etc., are all asp ects of a well - rounded applicant but should enhance rather than harm your GPA. Extracurricular Activities ********************************************************* There are many elements involved in becoming a competitive candidate for law school. In a ddition to superior grades and strong performance on the LSAT, law schools will be interested in your extracurricular activities, leadership experience, summer jobs, internships, and public service since they seek well - rounded candidates for admission. Se lect activities that interest you; they do not have to be directly related to law. Over time, get more actively involved in fewer activities , perhaps in an leadership position. Your academic department may have directed studies and research opportunitie s available. This is a good place to start. In addition, The University of Memphis provides support to students interested in obtaining an internship through the Office of Academic Internships : . memphis.edu/internships/ . There are over 150 registered student organizations at The University of Memphis . Students should review the database of organizations for membership criteria and contact information: . The Pre - Law Society hosts informational meetings each month on topics such as admissions, LSAT preparation, and career options in the legal profession. Students can contact the Pre - Prof essional Advisor for membership information. A full schedule of events hosted by the Pre - Law Society is available on the pre - law calendar of events. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 8 Legal Though t & Liberal Arts Minor The Legal Thoug ht and Liberal Arts Minor is designed to provide an interdisciplinary liberal arts program for students in any major who intend to enter the legal profession. The minor will be of particular benefit to pre - law students whose majors are more professional in nature and who are not exposed to the broader liberal arts curriculum. Students will be introduced to major intellectual traditions of the West and to ethical, social, and economic issues of significance to our time. The courses in the mi nor require that students read critically, think logically, and write clearly ; all of which are attributes required of persons in the legal profession. Students should visit 107 Scates Hall to declare a minor in Legal Thought and Liberal Arts.

NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 10 Determining Where to Apply With 2 accredited law schools in the United States, the process of deciding where to apply, and ultimately wher e to attend, may seem daunting. To make the process manageable, begin assem bling a list of schools based on the criteria that are important to you, and then revise your choices according to your chances of admission. Do not let the search for "long shots, good chances, and sure things" govern your selection process. Selecting sch ools carefully will help reduce the time and expense of applying to an excessive number of schools. Two resources that will help you determine your competitiveness for schools are the Official Guide to ABA - Approved Law Schools and the Boston College Online Law School Locator . Reputation ************************** ******************************* including faculty, facilities, and career services . There are many types of rankings for law schools, ranging from personal rankings to the US News and World Report St andings. However, it is very important to understand all rankings are subjective , and the methodology in most rankings is not very sound. Therefore, it is best for you to visit law schools, talk to admission representatives, and make an informed decision a bout which schools best meet your individual needs and interests. Selectivity at law schools, however, is one factor which can be quantified. You can to the overall numb er of applications. The Official Guide to ABA - Approved Law Schools contains charts and tables of recent admissions cycles at most schools that reflect selectivity. Schools can be divided roughly into three groups: Schools with national reputations tend to appear in various "top ten" lists. These schools draw students from a national pool and offer ge ographic mobility to graduates. Schools with good regional reputations are attended primarily by students from the region, who may want to remain in the are a following graduation, but who may also seek po sitions throughout the country. Local schools draw students primarily from the immediate area who want to remain there to practice law following graduation. For a more detailed discussion of law school repu tation and the process for evaluating schools, refer to the Official Guide to ABA - Approved Law Schools . NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 11 Criteria for Selection ********************************************************* Location: Is the school in an urban area or in a suburban/rural sett ing?

NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 12 Understanding Admissions Criteria Objective Criteria ********************************************************* Law schools c onsider the objective criteria, GPA and LSAT score, to be the factors that most accurately predict how applicants will perform in their first year. Law School Admission Test (LSAT) : Applicants take the LSAT, a half - day standardized test, during one of four test adm inistrations offered annually by the Law School Admission Council. Scores, which range from 120 to 180, are used by most law schools as a common measurement of potential for success in law school. Undergraduate Grade Point Average (GPA) : Applicants submit undergraduate transcripts to the Credential Assembly Service ( CAS ), which converts grades to a cumulative grade point average usi ng a set of consistent values. The GPA offers admissions committees another numerical basis for comparing applicants. Applica nt Index : Many law schools ask the CAS scores and GPAs with weighted constants to produce a single number which can be used to assess and compare potential for doing well. Subjective Criteria ********************************** *********************** Although your GPA and LSAT score are a very large piece of the admissions puzzle, law schools also take into account some subjective criteria. Personal Statement: A pplicants submit a personal statement as part of the application proce ss for almost all law schools. Admissions committees look for a concise, detailed, well - written statement revealing the applicant's individuality. They want to learn from the statement who the applicant is and what makes him/her qualified to study at their law schools. Letters of Recommendation: Most law schools require applicants to submit letters of recommendation from professors or employers to gain a different onal qualities. Admissions off motivation and intellectual curiosity, an assessment of communication skills, and a comparison with peers. Experience: This factor includes undergraduate curricular and extracurricular activities , i nternships , part - time and full - time work experience. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 13 Applying to Law School After reaching the decision to pursue a law degree, you will want to file a strong and complete application to increase your chances for admission. The first step in the applica tion process will be to meet with the Pre - Professional Advisor or Faculty Affiliate Advisor , who can help you create a strategy for maximizing your chances for success. Next you should open an online account with the Law School Admission Council (LSAC). LSAC is comprised of the 205 American Bar Association - approved law schools in the U.S. and 15 Canadian law schools, and was founded to coordinate and facilitate the process of applying to law school. Application Costs ************************************ ********************* B e aware that applying to law school is an expensive endeavor. Basic costs include: CAS registration fee LSAT registration fee Law School Reports A pplication fees (per school) Y ou might need to add other costs such as LSAT preparat ion, travel to visit law schools, etc. LSAC offers fee waivers for those with a demonstrated inability to pay for essential parts of the application. The waivers cover two LSATs per testing year (June through February ); the CAS registration, including a total of four CAS Law School Reports; and, a copy of The Official LSAT SuperPrep . Filing Your Applications ********************************************************* Remember that your file is not complete until all parts, including the recommendation lett ers and the CAS report, have been received by law schools. Completing application forms is a fairly straightforward process. Schools will be seeking basic information about you, including your academic background, extracurricular activities, and employmen t history. You may be asked to list other schools to which you are applying; responding to this question and/or indicating an interest in financial aid will not affe ct your chances for admission. Be truthful and forthright as you complete the applications . Enclose a resume with your application, but be sure to respond to all of the questions on the applications. ********************************************************* m that applicants have not been involved in academic or disciplinary transgressions as undergraduates. At The University of Memphis, this certification is handled by The Office of Student Conduct (359 University Center; studentconduct@memphis.edu). NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 14 Law Sc hool Admission Test (LSAT) The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is required for admission to all American Bar Association - approved law schools. The test is administered four times per year by the Law School Admission Council (LSAC). Detailed test informa tion regarding dates, sites, registration forms, fees, and deadlines, as well as registration, is available online. LSAT test sites can fill quickly, especially in or around major cities. It is advisable to register several months in advance of a test dat e so that you can take the test in a convenient location. Scheduling the LSAT ********************************************************* The optimal time to take the exam is June of the year you apply, but taking the test in the fall will still allow you to see your LSAT score before applying. Scores from the December administration will reach law schools in time to complete application deadlines at all schools. If you take the December test, plan to submit your applications around the time of the test. Yo u may, however, decide to wait to see your score before submitting your applications. prepared for each attempt. Content and Scoring ************************************ ********************* The LSAT is designed to provide law school admissions committees with a common measure of applicants' aptitude for legal study. The test consists of five multiple choice sections, each thirty - five minutes in length: One reading comp rehension section One analytical reasoning section Two logical reasoning sections One experimental test question section (not scored) A 35 - minute writing sample at the end of the test is also not scored; copies of the writing sample are sent to schools wh ere you apply. Your score is computed on a scale of 120 to 180, based on the number of questions you answer correctly; there is no deduction or penalty for incorrect answers, so it is advantageous to guess if you do not have time to answer a question. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 15 LSAT Preparation ********************************************************* Begin your preparation with LSAC materials and then assess your progress. If you feel you would benefit from a more structured program of study, you may want to consider taking a commercial test preparation course. There are a number of companies that offer test prep including Kaplan, ExamKrackers, and Princeton Review , as well as various printed study materials. The University of Memphis does not suggest any one particular method of test preparation over another and encourages students to research all options and devise a study plan that works best for each individual. Commercial courses are expensive and the quality of instruction can be uneven, so it is important to learn who wi ll be teaching the course and what materials will be used. Talk with others who have taken the LSAT to learn from their experience, especially concerning the effectiveness of courses you may be considering. Most students consider the logical reasoning s ections to be the most difficult part of the LSAT. Students are strongly encouraged to complete Philosophy 1611: Elementary Logic as a means of developing skills related to approaching questions of this nature. If you are registered for a test but feel y ou are not fully prepared or in a frame of mind to perform well, it may be better not to take the test; law schools will not view your absence on the test date negatively. Plan to be well - prepared and to take the test only once, but if you do not believe y our score is representative of your abilities, for example, you were scoring considerably higher on practice tests, you may want to consider retaking the test. Score Reporting ********************************************************* Law schools are req uired to report the highest scores for students in their entering class to the American Bar Association. Those scores are then reported to organizations such as the Law School Admission Council for use in their online and print information. Schools var y, however, in how they consider multiple LSAT scores in making admissions decisions. Though many schools use the higher/highest score in reaching decisions, some of the more competitive schools use the average of multiple scores unless there is a compelli ng reason to use the higher/highest score. Most schools welcome an addendum explaining the point difference in scores, including any extenuating circumstances and a history of performance on standardized tests. LSAC will report the results of all LSAT s you have taken within five years; however, you may find some schools willing to consider only scores received within a three - or four - year period. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 16 Credential Assembly Service (CAS) To centralize and standardize the objective application information ( GP As and LSAT score s) ABA - approved law schools require applicants to subscribe to the Cred ential Assembly Service (CAS). Th is service organizes and analyzes applicant information in a way that allows law schools to compare academic records from undergraduate schools that use different grading systems. CAS Registration ********************************************************* You register for the CAS through your LSAC account. Once registered, you will then send or take transcript request forms, available th rough CAS, to each college or university from which you have earned academic credit. CAS Report ********************************************************* T he report prepared by CAS will include the following: A year by year grade and credit summary. P hotocopies of all your transcripts. Your GPA for each academic year, your degree GPA for your home institution, and your cumulative GPA reflecting work at your home institution and all other institutions you have attended. A description of y our overall g rade distribution . The mean LSAT score and GPA of students at your undergraduate school who have subscribed to the CAS and your percentile graduation rank among those students. Up to 12 LSAT scores from the past five years, including cancellations and ab sences. An average LSAT score, if you have more than one score on file. Copies of your LSAT writing sample. Th e CAS report may also include an applicant index described in the Admissions Criteria section. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 17 Personal Statements Personal state ments are requested by most law schools and provide you with the opportunity to go beyond the objective aspects of the application to discuss who you are and what is important to you. Your personal statement is crucial since the majority of law schools do not conduct interviews as part of the application process. Personal statements provide law schools with a chance to review your writing skills and your ability to follow instructions. Personal Statement Content **************************************** ***************** Schools will be seeking information about your background, personal qualities and leadership skills, and motivation to learn what is unique about you and what distinguishes you from other candidates with similar GPAs and LSAT scores. Your goal, then, will be to write a concise, detailed statement establishing yourself as an individual. An interesting and personal discussion about yourself, one that reveals your personality and character, will help you come aliv e to the admissions committe e. Your personal statement is your opportunity to highlight your accomplishments, address any serious obstacles you have overcome, and touch on noteworthy personal experiences and how these have been impactful. It is important to remember that your persona l statement should not be an expanded version of your resume and that it highlights you and what you learned from the experience (s) , rather than just the experience itself. Some schools will ask you to respond to a specific question or suggest a topic fo r your personal statement, but most will leave it open - ended. If you are applying to a school with a specific prompt, it is important to clearly ad dress what they are asking for. Many applicants will write one personal statement and then adapt it to meet t he requirements of each school. This is perfectly acceptable, however, make sure you School B by mistake. Your statement should be serious, honest, and sincere, and the tone sh ould be confident and positive; any negative information you feel compelled or are required to discuss should be addressed in other parts of the application or in an addendum. Personal Statement Format ************************************************ ********* Personal statements are typically two double - spaced pages, though you may find that some schools will give more latitu de in length. If schools do not provide guidelines on length, it is advisable to submit a statement that is appr oximately two pa ges in length. A few schools will limit the number of words permitted and you should abide by their guidelines. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 18 Law schools will be looking for evidence that you can write a coherent statement. Follow general guidelines for writing essays: there shoul d be introductory and concluding paragraphs , each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence , and there should be a clear line of development through the statement . Support your ideas with concrete examples and use action words to show the reader, rather than just tell them. Allow the reader to draw inferences from your descript ions rather than explicitly sta ting your positive q ualities. Listing your strengths is never good ; rather, you want to develop an essay that showcases those qualities (character, v alues, commitment, passion, etc.) . Proofread carefully, as any typographical or grammatical errors will detract from the favorable impression the statement might otherwise make. Do not use large words in an attempt to impress readers; instead, use simpl e language correctly, and rely on well - organized, interestin g content to make an impression. Seek advice and input from various people once you have written your personal statement. Addendum ********************************************************* As m entioned above, you typically do not want to discuss negative information in your personal statement. If there is a weakness in your application and you think your explanation will help your cause, you should address it i n the addendum. Your discussion in the addendum should be brief and to the point; identify the issue, describe how you dealt with it, and state the outcome. Remember, an addendum is not a second personal statement. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 19 Letters of Recommendation Most law schools request tha t one or two letters of recommendation be subm itted on behalf of applicants. Even if letters of recommendation are not required, you are still strongly encouraged to submit them. Admissions committees will be seeking information not provided elsewhere in t he applicatio ns. Recommendation letters should include concrete examples of intellectual strength, judgment, motivation, and leadership, along with an appraisal of communication skills and a comparison to peers. Appropriate Letter Writers ************** ******************************************* Recommendation l etters written by members of the academic community carry the most weight, since they can address your performance in an academic setting and discuss your poten tial for success in law school. Law schools value letters that address a student's writing, class participation, research, analytical skills, and other academic abilities. They are especially interested in a professor's assessment of a student, as compared to other students he or she has tau ght over the years. At least one letter should be from a professor in your undergraduate major, if possible. As you consider whom to ask, remember that it is better to have an in - depth letter from a teaching assistant or lecturer with whom you worked cl osely than to have a cursory letter from a renowned professor who barely knows you. Letters from people outside academia may carry less weight, since they may be unable to address the topic of greatest interest to admissions commit tees: your academic pote ntial. However, if you have been in the work force a couple of years or more, letters from supervisors can be helpful. Law schools are typically less impressed with letters from well - known politicians since the letters tend to be demonstrative in praise b ut Asking for a Recommendation ********************************************************* Make an appointment to meet with letter writers well in advance of the applica tion deadline. Ask them, "Do you feel you know my work well enough to write a positive letter on behalf of my application to law school?" Provide information about your background to assist him/her in writing a detailed letter: A c opy of your transcript . A draft of your p ersonal statement. A resume. Co pies of exams or papers written in his/her class . R ecommendation forms from CAS or the law schools . S tam ped envelopes addressed to LSAC. A list of dates when recommendations are due. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 20 Be sure to discuss wai ving your right of access to your letters. You may want to waive your right since you may find some writers unwilling to write letters if applicants have access to them, and some admissions committee members may discount disclosed letters. If you have no t been notified that your application is complete by about one month before a deadline, contact the school to see if your recommendations have arrived. Speak with those writers who have not sent letters yet to remind them politely of the approaching deadli ne. After you have received decisions, send thank - you letters to your recommenders, and let them know where you have been accepted and where you intend to enroll. Number of Recommendations ********************************************************* You can submit additional letters even though a school asks for only one or two. Three letters will be acceptable at most schools, and four should be considered the absolute maximum. Letter of Recommendation (LOR) and Evaluation Service *********************** ********************************** LOR and Evaluation services are offered as a convenience to Credential Assembly Service (CAS) registrants, recommendation/evaluation writers, and law schools. A letter discusses the qualities and characteristics of the ap plicant's ability, academic and otherwise, to study law. An evaluation rates both cognitive and noncognitive attributes and skills that have been identified as important to successful lawyering, using a scale that represents degrees of a particular charact eristic. Letters may be submitted electronically or on paper, depending on the recommender's preference; evaluations are completely electronic. Use of LSAC's LOR or Evaluation service is optional unless a law school to which you are applying states that i ts use is required. These services allow you to use your LSAC.org account to have your LORs and evaluations sent to law schools based on each school's requirements or preferences. ( - to - law - school/cas/lor - evaluations ) Letters will be maintained for five years from the time you register for CAS or from the time you take the LSAT, whichever comes last. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 21 A dmissions Decisions The timetable f or reviewing law applications and informing applicants of admissions decisions varies from school to school. Notifications can come any time between December and late spring/early summer. Applicants are informed by e - mail or letter of the schools' decision s; candidates are either accepted, denied, or wait - listed, which means the applicant is considered a desirable candidate and may be admitted later. Law schools often place applicants on "hold" or "reserve" prior to reaching a decision and frequently not ify candidates of this status. Applications of those on hold or reserve are reconsidered at a later date, usually before the files of those who have been wait - listed. Enhancing Your Application ********************************************************* Th ere are several things you can do to improve your chances of admission if you are on rese rve or have been wait - listed: Write a letter to the director of admissions to inform him/her of your strong interest in the school and to provide an update on your activities since yo u submitted your application. If the school is your first choice, state that you will attend if accepted . If you are a senior, inform the school of accomplishments since you applied. Perhaps you have completed your honors thesis or you were accepted into Phi Beta Kappa. If you are currently working, describe your professional responsibilities and include an updated resume. Send an additional letter of recommendation from a professor or employer; however, the total number of recom mendation letters on your behalf should not exceed four. Visit the law school to demonstrate your strong interest. Contact the admissions office to arrange a tour and sit in on a class or two. Some admissions officers will agree to meet with applicants, but generally these discussions are not evaluative. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 22 Making a Decision ********************************************************* An actual visit to the law schools you have been admitted to can be invaluable when making your final decision. Not only wi ll you be able to take a tour of each school and attend classes, you have the opportunity to meet faculty and staff and speak with current students about their perspective on factors important to you, such as accessibility of faculty, career services, comp etitiveness of students , etc. Follow up with a thank - you letter to the admissions office stating what impressed you about the school. If you are unable to visit the school, contact the admissions office to inquire about current students and alumni who may be available to speak with you. Cost and financial aid awards should also be cons idered when making a decision. If you will be entering law school with debt accumulated as an undergraduate, f inancial factors can play an even greater role in your decision. Ultimately, you need to decide which school is best for you and where you can thrive as a law student. Your performance in law school will have a significant impact on the type of employment opportunities available to you after graduation. You will typic ally be required to submit a deposit to each school you are accepted to, to hold your space. Deposits may be due before you hear from all schools. Contact schools that accept you to explain your situation and ask if they would be willing to extend the depo sit deadline. Once you have reached a final decision on which school you will attend, notify all schools you were accepted to so that they can offer your seat to someone else. Reapplying Later ********************************************************* If you are not accepted at a law school you would like to attend, consider retaking the LSAT if you feel that you can improve your score, or revising your list of schools if you decide to reapply. Working for a few years can make a difference in the admissi ons process and can also provide exposure to another career field that might engage your interest. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 23 Financing Law School Law school is an important investment in your future. Consider the financial aid process as seriously as you do the law school appl ication process. Before you apply to law school, spend money wisely and pay your bills on time t o ensure a good credit record. Bad credit will affect your ability to borrow money. If possible, pay off credit cards and other consumer debt before law school. Think about your post - law school goals . Salaries for lawyers vary widely, depending on th e type of practice and region. Law school debt may claim a significant por tion of your income as a lawyer, so consider ways to keep debt at a minimum, such as state - supported schools or schools that offer merit - based aid. If you are considering a career in government or public interest law, investigate loan repayment assistance programs (LRAPs) that help law school graduates repay their education debt. Funding Sou rces ********************************************************* aw student Frugality can be your best friend when preparing for law school . Personal Sav ings/Family Support : If possible, set aside your own funds to help pay for law school. Talk with family members about whether they can help with law school expenses. Some students choose to live at home during law school to avoid paying rent. Federal Lo ans : Many students rely primarily on federal loan programs to finance law school. Total federal aid is available to cover (but not exceed) the and board, books and supplies, transpo rtation, and other expenses. Because you are applying for graduate study, you are considered independent of your parents for these loans. Private Loans : Credit is an important factor in securing private loans. Interest rates, fees, and terms of repaymen t vary significantly. It is best to work with your law school financial aid office BEFORE making a decision about loans for law school. Beware of direct marketing from private lenders. It is possible to finance your legal education entirely through federa l financial aid programs which are regulated by the federal government and typically have lower interest rates. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 24 Grants and Scholarships : Grants and scholarships are offered by law schools based upon criteria set by the school, which can include acade mic merit, financial nee d, ethnicity, specific talents, residency or other qualifications. Check with each law school early in the application process for more information. Law schools may offer merit scholarships to highly qualified applican ts with an of fer of admission. When law schools consider your financial need, they may require family income information even if you are considered independent for tax purposes, or for federal education loans. Some states provide limited grants for law school; there ar e no fe deral grants for law students. Certain national foundations and organizations offer grants and scholarships for law school through a competitive application process. Earnings: The American Bar Association sets limits on the number of hours a first - year law student can work per week. After the first year, many law students obtain summer employment and part - time empl oyment during the school year. This can help reduce the amount of money borrowed. Applying for Financial Aid ********************* ************************************ Before you begin the financial aid process, check your credit. You can order a free copy of your credit report from annualcreditreport.com ; once you rece ive your report you should review the information for accuracy. Certain loans may not be available to you if your credit history does not meet minimum standards. for t heir aid deadlines. Some schools have priority dates for submitting financial aid information; students who apply earlier have a better opportunity to obtain limited grant money. Complete your FAFSA as soon as pos sible after January 1. Completion of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is required for all federal student loan programs. The FAFSA is also used by some law schools to collect information fo r their own institutional aid. Because the FAF SA requires tax information from the previous year, it cannot be completed before January 1. Some schools have separate applications for financial aid, while others use the law school application or the FAFSA. Schools also vary in how they distribute thei r own funds. Do not wait to complete the FAFSA until after you are admitted to a law school. You can list up to six law schools where you want reports sent, and update this list with additional schools. If you have special circumstances, provide this in formation to the law school financial aid office. This can be critical for law students who have been working full - time in the prior year or who have unusual medical or family expenses. NAPLA Pre - Law Guide /University of Memphis Updated May 2015 25 Financial Aid Decisions ************************************** ******************* Once you have provided all required information, law schools can offer you a fi nancial aid package. To determine your financial need, schools take the estimated contribution calculated by the federal government on your FAFSA and subtra ct it In deciding which law school to attend, it is important to balance your financial considerations with other criteria, such as reputation, location, size, faculty, programs and placement success. Compare the n et of your projected costs at each school you are considering, offset by any offers of grants or scholarships from the school, to determine the amount you will need to make up through loans or personal funds. Once you have chosen a law school, expect to receive important additional financial information from the school. Even though you have already completed the FAFSA and law school financial aid forms, you must still apply for the loans. Your law school financial aid office will help you identify the c orrect process f or securing federal loans, and, if needed, private loans . Do your homework to compare fees and repayment terms for all of your loans, using loan calculators avail able on financial aid websites. Keep good records of all loan transactions. Borrow only what you need, and not more, to keep your debt low and your monthly repayment amount manageable.
