Philosoph y The study of Philosophy involves not merely the learning of philosophical questions, but the examination of the reasons for and defense of these positions, and the development of a critique of them. The Department of Philosophy offers cour ses in all areas of philosophy. It is an active and growing department, with teaching and research strengths in the history of philosophy and in both analytic and continental approaches to contemporary philosophical issues. The philosophy major is also a n excellent preparation for a number of other careers. At T he University of Memphis, as at most schools, philosophy is a common pre - law major, and many of our graduates have been admitted to such top law schools as Harvard, Yale, the University of Virgini a and the University of Tennessee. As a preparation for the theological seminary, an emphasis on the Ancient and Medieval periods puts a philosophy major well ahead of other students, and the preparation in critical thinking is a significant advantage in these and other fields. In fact, the demonstrated superiority of philosophy majors on th e standardized graduate tests such as GRE, LSAT, and M CAT, continues to be reflected in recent local data. Valuable skills and their applications Philosophy student s develop many valuable skills that serve them well in graduate school and in their career s : Analytic skills: the ability to identify and specify the key issue in a complex text Argumentative skills: the ability to develop a convincing case for or against a position Research skills: the ability to locate and isolate material relevant to a claim Communications skills: the ability to present complex positions clearly and concisely. Opportunities: The Philosophy Circle , which is comprised entirely of underg raduate students, provides social and intellectual activities in regular meetings focusing on issues of current student interest. It also hosts public lectures by prominent philosophers. The University of Memphis Undergraduate Philosophy Conference is an annual conference held in conjunction with the Mid - South Philosophy Conference. This conference brings in undergraduate philosophy students from all around the country. The Spindel Conference has been held annually since 1981, bringing international ly pro minent philosophers to cam pus for three days of lectures and discussion . Awards : the department presents two awards every year to undergraduate students: the Carroll R. Bowman Scholarship, and the Outstanding Student Award.
