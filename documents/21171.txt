African and African American Studies The African and African American Studies Program (AAAS) at The University of Memphis is a challenging, interdisciplinary curriculum designed to help you analyze the historical and contemporary issues associated with the African and African American experience. You will compare, evaluate, and finally synthesize various disciplinary approaches in order to achieve a sophisticated understanding of the history and contemporary dynamics of African, American, and European c ultures. AAAS offers a Bachelor of A rts (B . A . ) degree, as well as a minor that can enhance majors in literature, history, sociology, political science, and many other disciplines. What does a program in AAAS look like? That depends on you! There are three required core courses, presenting the theoretical framework and methodology for a cultural approach to the African and African American experience. After that, you can choo se one of three specializations: the Humanities, the Social and Behavioral Sci ences, or the Arts. This specialization will focus the design of your individual program around courses in the following departments: Anthropology; Art History; Communications; Criminology and Criminal Justice; Earth Sciences; Economics; English; History ; Mu sic History ; Philosophy; Political Science; Psychology; and Sociology. AAAS students develop skills that employers in many fields need: Analytic skills, to formulate and solve problems Argumentative skills, to construct useful analogies and elicit hidden assumptions Research skills, to integrate diverse data C ommunications skills , to express thoughts clearly and precisely in both oral and written discourse You can participate in an exciting study abroad sem inar in Ghana. You will be introduced to the long history and rich cultures of Ghana through an intensive, interdisciplinary study and travel abroad experience. The program includes lectures, discussion sessions, and guided visits to historic and cultura l sites in Ghana. You can join the African Students Association or the Black Students Association, active communities of students whose activities and events will give you unique educational and social experiences.

In 1901, Dr. W.E.B. DuBois noted that the twentieth century's most critical issue would continue to be the problem o f the "color line," and "the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea." DuBois' assessment continues to be true for the twenty - first century and is a key reason for majoring in African and African American Studies. African and African American Studies helps to develop an understanding of: 1. the histories and cultures of African and African American peoples in the Diaspora; 2. the i mpact of race and ethnicity in A merican society; 3. how race and ethnicity have interacted with class, gender, sexuality and other factors to shape American institutions. Is African and African American Studies only for African and African American Students? While the focus of this program is on African and African Ame rican peoples, these courses are not limited to African and African American students . African and African American S tudies is for students of all national, ethnic and religious backgrounds. African and African American studies should be viewed in the cont ext of world and human history. The historical and contemporary development of African and African American people, like that of people of European and Asian descent, is relevant and significant to human history in general.
