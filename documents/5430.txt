Under her guidance, HealthTeamWorks® served as the lead organization in Colorado for the national Improving Performance in Practice initiative to help practices redesign their systems to improve qual ity, safety, efficiency and satisfaction for patients and the healthcare team. The program, piloted in Colorado and North Carolina, has now spread to seven states. Expanding on this work and linking it to payment reform, HealthTeamWorks® in 2008 convened t he Colorado Multi - Payer Patient - Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Pilot, bringing together seven health plans, 16 practice sites and many other stakeholders. HealthTeamWorks® provided technical assistance and quality improvement coaching to the practices. That work prompted the CMS Innovation Center to choose Colorado as one of seven national regions for the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, a multipayer project that will provide enhanced compensation for high - quality, coordinated, patient - centered primary care. HealthTeamWorks ® was chosen to provide PCMH coaching to more than 50 of the 73 practices selected for the project. Harbrecht is a member of the national Patient - Centered Primary Care Collaborative Payment Reform Taskforce and the NCQA PPC - PCMH Adviso ry Committee that helped develop the 2008, 2011 and 2014 PCMH standards.
