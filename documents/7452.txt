However, unlike gift aid, loans must be repaid. * Federal Direct Loans are offered in two forms: subsidized and unsubsidized. Subsidized: You will not be charged any interest while you are in school (as long as you remain at least a half - time student) the interest during this period . Students receiving a subsidized loan first d isbursed after July 1, 2012 and before July1, 2014 will be responsible for the interest that accrues on the loan during the six month grace period. Only available to undergraduate students who qualify. Unsubsidized: You are respo nsible for your interest. Your interest accrues within sixty (60) days of disbursement and may either be paid while you are in school or capitalized and added to the principal amount borrowed. As with subsidized loans, principal repayme nt begins six months after enrollment in an educational institution ceases. How Much Can I Borrow? * Your total financial aid, including Federal Direct Loans, can nev . The limits indicated are the federal maximums which you can receive during two terms of enrollment. * The maximum loan amount for one semester cannot exceed half of the academic year loan limit. * In addition to annual loan limits, there are aggregate loan limits.

In deciding the appropriate amount, you should follow these steps: 1. What are your costs for an academic year? Add you costs together for tuition/fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation and personal expenses. 2. Subtract your resources from these costs. Consider all aid and private scholarships you have received as well as money from savings and your family. 3. Decide if you need to borrow. Before you borrow funds, are there other resources available to you? Review your expenses to see if you can reduce your costs. 4. Consult the repayment chart to the right. What will be the monthly payment if you borrow this amount? Remember to consider what you may borrow in future years. 5. Select the amount that you can manage to repay. What you borrow today must be repaid, with interest, in the future. Remember to be as conse rvative as possible when borrowing funds.
