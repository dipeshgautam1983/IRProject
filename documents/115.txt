Donald K. Carson Leadership Scholarship Dr. Carson's Bio Contribution Information Current Scholars Carson Circle Application Home Donald K. Carson Leadership Scholarship Donald K. Carson Leadership Scholarship The Donald K. Carson Leadership Scholarship was established as a dream by Don's staff and close friends in 2002. Don worked at the University of Memphis for 30 years, retiring in 2003. For twenty-eight years, he was the Vice President for Student Affairs. The initial financial commitments came in rapidly with enthusiasm, support and love for this wise and special person. The scholarship was endowed at the $30,000 level within six months of establishing the scholarship. In announcing the scholarship to Don, the following thoughts were penned by a dear friend and put on a lasting plaque: To affirm in people their intrinsic worth is healing, but they may become complacent. To challenge people with a vision of their potential is redemptive, but they may become discouraged. To both affirm and challenge while fostering neither complacency nor discouragement is an act of grace. In honor of the profound grace he has brought into the lives of students and countless others, the friends of Dr. Donald K. Carson announce the establishment of the Donald K. Carson Leadership Scholarship at The University of Memphis on July 10, 2002. The scholarship is awarded by a committee headed by the Dean of Students and made up of staff and friends who understand "Doc's" values and beliefs. Dr. Carson has also agreed to be involved in the scholar selection process when he is available. It is awarded to a full-time student who has completed a minimum of 12 hours at the University of Memphis while maintaining a minimum cumulative 2.8 GPA.
