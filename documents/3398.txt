The "See Me" Award honors a University of Memphis faculty member who has been nominated by a student with a disability who is registered with Disability Resources for Students. Because many people are uncomfortable openly discussing issues of disability, the award is titled the "See Me" Award and the student nominee must write an essay detailing ways that the faculty member has shown understanding of disability and willingness to learn about disability. The student nominator must also give examples of how the faculty member has demonstrated their willingness to assist the student as a learner. Most importantly, the faculty member must show respect in seeing the student and his or her abilities, while acknowledging issues of disability. Past "See Me" Award recipients: 2014: Dr. Sandra Sarkela 2013: Dr. Jeff Wilson and Ms. Michelle Bliss 2012: Dr. Sally Ross 2011: Ms. Rachel Martin 2010: Dr. Sarah Clark Miller 2009: Dr. Charles Hall 2008: Dr. Anna Bess Sorin DRS Staff Awards: Disability Resources for Students (DRS) and Career Services received the 2011 Robert Greenberg Award for Innovation at the Career Opportunities for Students with Disabilities (COSD) conference in November 2011.
