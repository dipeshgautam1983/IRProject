Honors Program The Honors Program in Sociology requires 18 hours of honors work, at least 12 hours of which must be upper-division sociology courses. To complete the Honors Program, a student must have a minimum overall final grade point average of 3.00 in Sociology, and a 3.25 grade point average in honors course work. Those students who complete the program and the regular college requirements will be recognized at the commencement ceremony by having their degree conferred “With Honors in Sociology.” Moreover, the student’s diploma and the record at the University of Memphis will reflect this distinction. Please see the department's Faculty Honors Advisor for more details on the program. Sociology Minor SOCI 1010 and 15 upper-division hours in SOCI. Accelerated B.A./M.A. Program in Sociology This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master of Arts in Sociology during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B.A./M.A. program early in their undergraduate career, in consultation with their advisor in the Department of Sociology. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B.A. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their M.A. To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Sociology department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in sociology. Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.A./M.A. program, which allows them to take graduate courses in sociology. To continue in the program past the B.A., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and into the Sociology department's M.A. program. Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply to undergraduate GPA.
