I am aware of prerequisites for my cour ses and the requirements for my degree. I have cleared any holds that ma y prevent me from registering. I know where I stand in each of my current classes. Questions to ask and comments to go over with your advisor Are there alternate courses that I can take in the event some course s are closed or do not fit in my schedule? Where do I find information about internships/scholarships/tutoring? Inform your advisor of any changes in your plans since the last time you met. Are you adding/dropping a minor? Are you addi ng a second major? Ask your advisor about campus resources to enrich your University of Memphis experience.
