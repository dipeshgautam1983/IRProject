The Methodist Le Bonheur Center for Healthcare Economics Octo ber 2015 Health Policy Blog HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES: WHO IN TENNESSEE HAS ENROLLED? I. WHAT IS THE QUESTION ? A critical component of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was which people may compare, select, and purchase private, individual health insurance plans. 1 I n this Health Policy Blog , we will examine the participation of Tennesseans in these HIEs. Specifically, we will present information related to five questions : H ow many Tennesseans have selected health insurance plans through an HIE? W hat types of plans did they select? W hat was the role of federal subsidies in Exchange participation in Tennessee? H ow has enrollment evolve d since the Exchanges opened in October 2013? How did Exchange enrollment impact the uninsured in Tennessee? II. WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND ? The basic goal of the HIEs is to expand health insurance coverage by reduc ing the cost of private , individual health insurance plans . The ACA sought to do so by establishing a competitive in which consumers may openly compare costs and benefits among several plans and then select the one that best meets their needs and resources. In addition, enrolling in an insurance plan through an 1 Questions About Health Insurance Exchanges , online at . Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 2 HIE allowed enrollees to secure federal subsidies provided by the ACA for low - and middle - income beneficiaries. The ACA established two general models for HIEs. First, a state may develop and operate its own HIE. Second, if a state chose not to do so, a federal HIE known as the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM or, more simply , established to serve its residents. 2 To date, 37 states including Tennessee have opted to participate in the FFM, whereas the remaining states have implemented their own HIE. 3 Enrollment in the Marketplace began on October 1, 2013, with the first open enrollment period (with various extensions) running through March 31, 2014. The second open enrollment period ran from November 15, 2014 , through February 15, 2015. In addition to this second scheduled open enrollment period, a through April 15, 2015 , for potential enrollees who had initiated but not completed applications by the deadline and for selected other groups. In addition, enrollmen t remains continuously open for applicants with significant life events including, as examples, marriage, birth of a child, and involuntary loss of other insurance. 2 The Federally Facilitated Marketplace established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid is accessible at . 3 Medicaid Expansion , State Health Facts ( Washington, DC: The Kaiser Family Foundation ) .

MARKETPLACE ENROLLMENT IN TENNESSEE Marketplace enrollment after the second open enrollmen t period was analyzed , including the related SEP s , based on publicly - available data reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) . 4 , 5 , 6 Additional data included county - level information in the Area Health Resource File (AHRF) published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 7 and information collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the Kaiser Family Foundation, and other organizations. A. How Many Tennesseans Selected Health Insurance Plans Through the Marketplace ? Marketplace enrollment in Tennessee is presented in Exhibit I. The available data provide information on the number of Tennesseans participating at several stages in the enrollment process, including (1) the number of Tennesseans who completed an application ; (2) the number of applicants who were determined to be eligible for enrollment ; (3) the number of eligible applicants who selected a plan (referred to here ; (4) the n umber of applicants who selected a plan and paid their first premium to become fully enrolled who selected 4 Office of the Assistant Secreta ry for Planning and Evaluation , Health Insurance Marketplaces 2015 Open Enrollment Period: March Enrollment Report ( Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services, March 10, 2015 ) . 5 Office of the Assistant Secretar y for Planning and Evaluation , Plan Selections by County in the Health Insurance Marketplace ( Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services, July 2015 ) . 6 Centers for M edicare and Medicaid Services , June 30, 2015 Effectuated Enrollment Snapshot ( Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services, September 2015 ) . 7 Health Resources a nd Services Administration , Area Health Resources File, 2014 - 15 ed.

S ource: Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Department of Health and Human Services, March 10 and June 15, 2015, as cited in the text. Notes: APTC = Advanced Premium Tax Credits; CSR = Cost - Sharing Reduction S ubsidies. Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 5 As shown in Exhibit I, 390,237 Tennesseans completed an application to enroll in a Marketplace plan by the end of the second enrollment period (plus the related SEPs). Of these, 306,785 were determined to be eligible to enroll, 231,440 selected a Marketplace insurance plan, and 177,453 became effectuated enrollees as of June 30, 201 5. There was a significant dropout rate between each level of the process (Exhibit I). O nly 45.5 percent of those completing an application and 76.7 percent of those The fai lure of 23 .3 percent of persons selecting a plan to pay the first monthly premium likely reflects the continuing relatively high and rising financial burden of even the subsidized policies. 8 B. How Did They Enroll? Plan e nrollment in the second 2014 - 2015 open - enrollment period could be achieved by one of three processes. An enrollee m ight be a new consumer who w as never enrolled in a Marketplace plan prior to the second enrollment period. Persons who had been enrolled previously in a Marketpla ce plan could re - enroll during the second period by one of two methods : (1) by accessing the Marketplace an d actively choosing to re - enroll re - enrollees ) in the same plan or switching to a different 8 The Commonwealth Fund, Are Marketplaces Affor dable? Consumer Perspectives f rom the Commonwealth Fund Affordable Care Act Tracking Survey, March - May 2015 ( Washington, DC: The Commonwealth Fund, 2015 ). Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 6 plan or (2) by being automatically re - enrolled in the same plan if they did not actively return to the Marketplace to choose a plan . The number of Tennesseans who select ed a plan 9 through each of these enrollment paths is shown in Exhibit II. 9 Available data did not include this breakdown for effectuated enrollees. Hence, these data refer to all who selected a plan. - S ource: Evaluation, Department of Health and Human Services, March 10, 2015, as cited in the text. Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 7 Most persons selecting a plan (123,194 persons or 53.2% of the total who selected a plan ) during the second open - enrollment period were new enrollees. The remaining 46.8 percent of persons selecting a plan during the second open enrollment period had previously enrolled in a plan. The majority (54.6%) of these re - enrollees actively re - enrolled through the Marketplace website , and 60 .4 percent of those active re - enrollees switched plans during re - enrollment. Of those persons actively re - enrolling in a Marketplace plan, over half switched plans . This suggest s a significant role for effective comparative shopping in the Marketplace. C. W hat Types of Plans Did They Select? Five general categories of insurance plans are available through the Marketplace. Four are defined by the proportion of healthcare costs expected to b e covered by the plans, that is, their actuarial level. These plans include bronze (covering 60 .0 % of healthcare costs), silver (70 .0 % of healthcare costs), gold (80 .0 % of healthcare costs), and platinum (90 .0 % of healthcare includes plans that provide only limited catastrophic cove rage. Premiums generally increase as coverage level s increase, although there is significant variation in premiums and total out - of - pocket costs within a metal level. The proportion of effectuated enrollees in each metal level as of June 30, 2015 , is show n in Exhibit III. Most effectuated enrollees (73.0%) selected a silver plan . This choice likely reflects the role of silver plans in setting the level of APTC subsidies and as a requirement for CSR subsidies (discussed below). A much smaller number of Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 8 e nrollees selected the more expensive gold (4.1%) and platinum (1.6%) levels, consistent with the income distribution of enrollees. D. How Many Enrollees Received Federal Subsidies? The ACA includes two types of federal subsidies to facilitate insurance coverage. The Advanced Pr emium Tax Credit (APTC) provides subsidies for premiums (based on income and the local cost of the second least expensive silver plan) for citizens with incomes of 100 .0 perc ent to 400 .0 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). The Cost Sharing Reduction S ubsidies ( CSR ) cover a large portion of the out - of - pocket costs, Bronze 21.2% Silver 73.0% Gold 4.1% Platinum 1.6% Catastrophic 0.2% S ource: analyses of data reported by the Assistant Secret ary for Planning and Evaluation, Department of Health and Human Services, March 10, 2015, as cit e d in the text. Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 9 including deductibles, co - payments and co - insurance expenses, for citizens with incomes of 100 .0 percent to 250 .0 percent of the FPL who purchas e a silver plan . 10 Exhibit I include d the number of effectuated enrollees who were eligible to receive these subsidies as of June 30 , 2015 . Of the total 177,453 effectuated enrollees, 149,920 or 84.5 percent received APTC subsidies and 111,844 of these (63.0% of all effectuated enrollees) qualified for CSR subsidies. Thus, a substantial majority of Tennessee enrollees received federal subsidies to reduce the cost of insurance. As of June 30, 2015, APTC subsidies aver aged $221 per month and reduced the average monthly premium of a silver policy in Tennessee by 66 .0 percent , from $321 per month to $110 per month. Of the Tennessee APTC beneficiaries, 92 .0 percent could select a plan with premiums of $100 per month or lo wer, and 81 .0 percent could enroll in a plan with monthly premiums of $50 or less. 11 E. What Were the Significant Trends in Enrollment Between the Two Open Enrollment Periods? The total number of effectuated Marketplace enrollees increased by 69,409 , from 108,044 as of December 2014 , to 177,452 as of June 30, 2015 corresponding to a 64.2 percent increase between the two open - enrollment periods. 10 For more detailed information on subsidies, including eligibility details, see Explaining Health Care Reform: Questions About Health Insurance Subsidies ( Washington, DC: The Kaiser Family Foundation, October 2014 ) . 11 Office of the Assistant Secretary for P lanning and Evaluation , Health Insurance Marketplace 2015: Average Premiums After Advance Premium Tax Credits Through January 30 in 37 States Using the HealthCare.gov Platform ( Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services, February 9, 2015 ) . Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 10 The majority of increases between the two enrol l ment periods occurred in cohorts receiving federal subsidies ; 84 .0 percent of the increase in the number of effectuated enrollees occurred in the group with incomes under 400.0 percent of the FPL who were receiving APTC subsides. Virtually all (99.2%) of the increase was among those enrolling in plans with lower a ctuarial values, that is, bronze plans (31.8% of the increase) and silver plans (67.4% of the increase). IV. HOW DO ES MARKETPLACE ENR OLLMENT IMPACT TENNESSEE ? Establishing HIEs was a key component of the ACA aimed at expanding insurance coverage. In practice, t he Marketplace signup program got off to a rocky start in October 2013, but the operations recovered and became generally successful. As of June 30, 2015, 9.9 million Americans had enrolled in insurance plans through the Marketplace Exchanges. 12 When additional enrollees who gained coverage through Medicaid expansion and other ACA - initiated coverage initiatives were added, a total of 14.1 million adults had gained insurance since October 2013 , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Huma n Services . 13 As a result, t he national uninsured rate dropped correspondingly from 13.3 percent in 2013 to 10.4 percent in 2014. 14 A Gallop - 12 Office of the Assistant Secreta ry for Planning and Evaluation , Health Insurance Marketplaces 2015 Open Enrollment Period: March Enrollment Report ( Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services, March 10, 2015 ) . 13 U.S. Department of Health and Hum an Services , Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Assessment , Health Insurance Coverage and t he Affordable Care Act , May 5, 2015.

Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 11 Well Being poll reported that the uninsured rate in Tennessee likewise fell substantially, from 16.8 percent in 201 3 to 14.4 percent in mid - 2014. 15 A. Benefits of Health Insurance Coverage Numerous reports have documented the improved access to health care and improved health status among the newly insured. 16 , 17 A survey sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund showed that 73 .0 percent of previously uninsured people who used medical care indicated that they would not have been able to get that care before obtaining insurance. 18 A July 2015 study reported that : . . . the currently anticipated health insurance expansions would lead to a 5.1% increase in treatment rate among hypertensive patients. Such an increase in treatment rate is estimated to lead to 111,000 fewer new coronary heart disease events, 63,000 fewer stroke events, and 95,000 fewer cardiovascular disease or CVD - related deaths by 2050. 19 B. Impacts on Insurance Coverage in Tenne ssee The data in this report provide a broad overview of the impacts of the Marketplace on coverage in Tennessee.

Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 12 Marketplace enrollment on the reported declines in the overall uninsured rates is, however, complex. Many Marketplace enrollees may have been previously i nsured through other sources. A recent national survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that only 57 .0 percent of those with coverage through the Marketplace were previously uninsured. 20 Applying this proportion to Tennessee suggests that as many as 101,148 previously uninsured became insured through the Marketplace. In addition, other parts of the ACA as well as changing economic conditions play significant roles in the improvement in insurance coverage. These included Medicaid expansion in states that did , as well as those that did not (including Tennessee) , opt for full ACA - provided expansion; young adult coverage on parental policies; and many marketplace reforms. For example, a re cent national survey reported that almost twice as many newly insured gained coverage through employer - sponsored plans as through Exchanges and that increases in Medicaid enrollment exceeded th ose of Marketplace plans. 21 Indeed, data from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicate that Medicaid/CHIP enrollment in Tennessee increased by over 249,000 since the implementation of the ACA, 22 also exceeding the number of effectuated Marketplace enrollees (Exhibit I). 20 L .

A ccessed September 15, 2015. Health Policy Blog/ Who Has Enrolled? 13 C. The Potential for Greater Impact Marketplace enrol lment was substantial but represent s only a small proportion of the Tennesseans eligible for coverage and for subsidies. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicate that 579,000 Tennesseans were eligible for Marketplace policies as of June 2015 ; that is, they were eligible for tax credits, were uninsured or purchased non - group coverages, were not eligible for Medicaid/CHIP, and did not have access to employer - sponsored coverage. 23 Thus, only 30.6 percent of all eligible Tennesseans became covered as ef fectuated enrollees. Information from the Area Health Resource F ile further extends these observations. In 2012 (the last full year before ACA implementation), 875,363 Tennesseans under the age of 65 years were uninsured. Of these, 797,967 had incomes un der 400 .0 percent of the FPL (and were eligible for ATPC subsidies) and 570,302 had incomes under 200 .0 percent of the FPL (and were eligible for CSR subsidies). Thus , only 20.3 percent of all the uninsured, 31.1 percent of those with incomes under 200 .0 percent of the FPL, and 22.2 percent of those with incomes under 400 .0 percent of the FPL became fully covered through the Marketplace as effectuated enrollees. Numerous reasons may explain the low takeup rate of the uninsured and, especially, those eligib le for federal subsidies. These reasons include the substantial residual cost of coverage after subsidies (that is, the high prevalence and implications of 23 Kaiser Family Foundation , S tate Health Facts , available at - reform/state - indicator/marketplace - enrollment - as - a - share - of - the - potential - marketplace - population - 2015/?state=TN .

CONCLUSION E nrollment in health insurance plans through the Marketplace has been substantial in Tennessee . This participation has been associated with a significant reduction in the number of uninsured Tennesseans, although a precise quantification of the impact is difficult. There remains, however, significant opportunities for greater participation and greater insurance coverage among the currently unin sured, especially those eligible for subsidies, that may be achieved through enhanced outreach and education efforts by public and private groups and organizations. 26 *** End of Blog *** 24 C .
