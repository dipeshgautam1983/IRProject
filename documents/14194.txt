Studying for 25-30 minutes followed by a 5 minute break will keep you focused and less stressed. Use the timer on your phone or the Google Timer to help you keep track of time. Practice Re-reading and going over notes in a great way to study, but it is also important to quiz yourself. Quizlet and StudyBlue are two great free study tools that allow you to create quizzes and flashcards. Avoid Distractions While technology can be helpful when studying, too much technology can keep you from concentrating. To cut down on distractions, avoid music with lyrics. Also avoid using social media. There are several apps such as Self Control and FocalFilter that block distracting websites for a designated amount of time.
