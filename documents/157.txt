The course introduces students to the theories of international trade . We will start by introducing the traditional theories of international trade ( Ricardian model, HO model , I ncreasing R eturns to Scale model ), and ex plore their most recent developments We will be particularly focusing on explaining trade from the point of view of individual firms. From this perspective, we will first try and understand the determinants of the decision of firms to export or not and mor e generally the role of firms heterogeneity in shaping export decisions. W e will introduce multinational production as an additional/alternative possibility for firms to serve foreign markets. We will study the classical theory of multinational firms, bas ed on the proximity - concentration trade - off, and the firm level decision between trade and multinational production. We will explore more recent theory of the international organization of the firm, vertical specialization, outsourcing, and offshoring. We will also explore the effects of multinational production on trade patterns. Each lecture will provide in - depth coverage of a key contribution; students will be expected to do the readings in advance. Each week a key article will be assigned. Students are required to briefly read this article in advance of the lecture and to present to the class a related article that uses a similar framework.
