About Accessibility About accessibility Web accessibility refers to how easily people with disabilities can navigate and interact with websites. Disabilities may be physical (such as blindness, low vision, deafness, or fine motor skills difficulty), or cognitive (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder). People with disabilities often use assistive technologies to help them navigate the web. An assistive technology is any device that helps a person with a disability. Common web assistive technologies include modified mice and keyboards, screen readers and screen magnifiers. Web accessibility occurs when websites support web accessibility standards, are compatible with assistive technologies, and are easy for people to navigate and understand. At Desire2Learn we follow web accessibility standards closely and work with interested clients to test the usability of our products for people with disabilities. We believe that instructional practices should focus on helping people learn, and should not be limited by the learning management system the material is delivered in.
