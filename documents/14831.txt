The 1960s ushered in a period of profound change in Fayette County as African Americans and those sympathetic to their plight stood up and challenged their second-class citizenship. John and Viola McFerren emerged as the leaders of that movement, providing sustained guidance and support to the movement's efforts. In 1959, the McFerrens and other African American activists created the organization, The Fayette County Civic and Welfare League, later renamed The Original Fayette County Civic and Welfare League, to further their civil rights agenda. The League entered the 1960s with an urgent civil rights agenda: to increase voter registration; elect responsible government officials; improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks; and to dismantle racial barriers for blacks in Fayette County. In an article published on October 12, 1969, The New York Times , described the Fayette County Movement as the "longest sustained civil rights protest in the nation." In 2008, Freedom's Front Line (2008) received the Director's Choice Award at the Black Maria Film Festival, Newark New Jersey. Freedom's Front Line production team included Robert Hamburger, executive producer; Mark Lipman and David Villavert, directors and editor, respectively; Dillard Morrison, cinematography; and Daphene R. McFerren, film consultant. Support for this film was provided by The Civil Society Institute (Boston, MA); Hooks Institute; Sara Lutz (New York, New York); and the Small Change Foundation (San Francisco, CA).
