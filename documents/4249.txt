The Gambling Clinic Individuals Family/Friends Information Resources Contact Us What to Expect Home Gambling Expect What to Expect We can help you! We provide 100% confidential and affordable person-centered treatment to anyone interested. We focus on you as an individual and work with you to best suit your needs so that you can learn to control the troll. At The Gambling Clinic, we want to help you meet your goals. This could be to gamble less, gamble differently, or to stop gambling all together. Reducing the amount of time and money spent gambling can help minimize the negative effects you may be experiencing in your life. We are here to help you make these changes. The Gambling Clinic is located in the Psychological Services Center at The University of Memphis. We have treated over 450 individuals, are the most experienced gambling treatment facility in the region, and were selected as the gambling treatment facility for the Tennessee Department of Health. We believe outpatient care is an effective tool to help manage gambling. Research has not shown inpatient care to be more effective than outpatient care for gambling treatment. Our clients come from around the country, we are not limited to the Mid-South area. Cost is a major concern for most people with a history of gambling problems. We charge $150 for our treatment, which is typically 5 to 7 1-hour long sessions. However, we do not turn any one away for their inability to pay. If you would like to schedule an appointment to be seen by a therapist, please call us at 901-678-STOP. Usually, someone will get back to you within 48 hours to schedule a time to come in. If you are not sure you are ready to begin treatment, feel free to call us for more information. Gambling Lab Interested in gambling research?
