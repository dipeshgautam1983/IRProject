My program of research focuses on cultural, family, and behavioral factors that promote health and reduce morbidity in childhood chronic illness. More specifically, this research hopes to: 1) examine models of stress and adaptation to promote quality of life and regimen adherence among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families; 2) develop culturally-tailored interventions for youth with type 1 diabetes and their families; 3) identify the influence of cultural and family factors on children’s weight, diet, and mealtime behavior, with a particular focus on obesity in early childhood.; and 4) integrate quantitative and behavioral methodologies to inform, develop, and refine clinical health interventions and assessments to reduce and eliminate health disparities.
