Students who plan to transfer to University of Tennessee System universities or to out-of-state or private universities should check requirements and take the appropriate courses.Although the courses designated by Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) institutions to fulfill the requirements of the general education subject categories vary, transfer of the courses is assured through the following means: Upon completion of an A.A. or A.S. degree, the requirements of the lower-division general education core will be complete and accepted by a TBR university in the transfer process. If an A.A. or A.S. is not obtained, transfer of general education courses will be based upon fulfillment of complete subject categories. (Example: If all eight hours in the category of Natural Sciences are complete, then this block of the general education core is complete.) When a subject category is incomplete, course-by-course evaluation will be conducted. The provision of block fulfillment pertains also to students who transfer among TBR universities. Institutional/departmental requirements of the grade of C will be honored. Even if credit is granted for a course, any specific requirements for the grade of C by the receiving institution will be enforced. In certain majors, specific courses must be taken also in general education. It is important that students and advisors be aware of any major requirements that must be fulfilled under lower-division general education.Courses designated to fulfill general education at the University of Memphis are published below.

Identifying Courses Satisfying the Minimum Degree RequirementsAlthough the courses fulfilling the minimum degree requirements may vary in actual design among institutions, many contain similar content. These courses are identified by common course rubrics (prefixes) and numbers in all TBR institutions to facilitate transferability. The actual courses designated by each institution to fulfill the Minimum Degree Requirements, including courses that may not be a part of the common course prefix and numbering pattern, are denoted in catalogs by the w symbol. A complete matrix of courses that satisfy the Minimum Degree Requirements at all TBR institutions and an explanation of the common course rubric and numbering system are available on the TBR web page ( ).Explanation of course description format: The official course title appears in boldface type following the course number. The figures in parentheses after the course title denote the number of semester hours of credit for that course. If the credit is variable, to be determined by the department, that fact is indicated by the minimum and maximum credit, as BIOL 4000 (2- 4).If the phrase "Same as . . ." and another course number appear in parentheses following the credit hours, the course is cross listed with a course in another department, and when offered Women's Studies (WMST) Foreign Languages and LiteraturesArabic (ARAB) Chinese (CHIN) Classics (CLAS) French (FREN) German (GERM) Greek (GREK) Hebrew (HEBR) Italian (ITAL) Japanese (JAPN) Languages and Literature (LALI) Latin (LATN) Portuguese (PORT) Russian (RUSS) Spanish (SPAN) Fogelman College of Business and EconomicsAccountancy (ACCT) Business Administration (BA) Decision Sciences (ISDS) Economics (ECON) Finance, (FIR) Hospitality and Resort Management (HPRM) Management Information Systems (MIS) Management (MGMT) Marketing (MKTG) College of Communication and Fine ArtsArchitecture (ARCH) Art (ART) Art History (ARTH) Communication (COMM) Communication/Fine Arts (CCFA) Dance (DANC) Interior Design (IDES) Journalism (JOUR) Theatre (THEA) (2 of 4) [12/31/2008 2:32:47 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Course Descriptions :: University of Memphisby both departments, may be taken through either.

At the end of many course descriptions, prerequisites and/or corequisites are listed. Students are responsible for meeting the stated prerequisites prior to enrolling for the course.A [G] at the end of the course description indicates that the course may be used to fulfill University General Education Program requirements. These requirements vary somewhat according to the particular degree program or major.Courses are numbered according to the following system: 0001-0999 Courses for which the credit does not apply toward minimum degree requirements or for which credit is restricted. 1000-1999 Courses primarily for freshmen 2000-2999 Courses primarily for sophomores 3000-3999 Courses primarily for juniors 4000-4999 Courses primarily for seniors and for which graduate credit is not offered. (There is sometimes a corresponding 6000 number for which graduate credit is offered to graduate students who fulfill the additional requirements for such credit.)1000-2000 level courses are lower division courses, 3000-4000 level courses are upper division courses.

A town oriented to a rural economy and culture in 1900 grew into a large urban and commercial center mid-century, and the citys public institution of higher learning experienced comparable growth.The metropolitan and regional requirements for more highly trained university graduates have, of necessity, caused the University to expand all its offerings in arts and sciences, business, the fine arts, education, engineering and technology, law, and several special professional fields. Degrees range from the baccalaureate through the doctorate. Approximately 80 percent of the full-time faculty have earned the highest possible degree in their fields. The University strives to optimize its resources in its quest for excellence through teaching, research and service.With an enrollment of over 20,000, the University of Memphis is committed to developing programs of the highest caliber, for only through such a commitment will it be a standard of quality in higher education for the citizens of our service area. As the comprehensive university of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee, the University of Memphis is striving to increase the ratio of doctoral programs it offers, which will also require an increased emphasis on research and scholarship activity. The University is committed to serving a diverse student body of all races, sexes and nationalities. Our students are expected, upon graduation, to be able to compete effectively with their counterparts from any other respected university in the nation.HistoryThe roots of the University of Memphis date back to September 12, 1912, with the establishment and beginning of classes at West Tennessee State Normal School, which provided for the training History of the University Mission of the University Office of the (1 of 2) [12/31/2008 2:35:50 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: General Description :: University of Memphisof primary and secondary education teachers. However, the seeds for the normal school's creation were sown three years earlier, in 1909, when the Tennessee General Assembly passed a General Education law calling for establishment and maintenance of three normal schools, one school located in each of the three grand divisions of the state.The eastern edge of Memphis became the site for West Tennessee State Normal School, which in 1929 became West Tennessee State Teachers College. In 1941, the college expanded its liberal arts curriculum, and the name was changed to Memphis State College--an institution serving three to four thousand students. The undergraduate program was reorganized into three schools and a graduate school was added in 1951.Memphis State achieved university status in 1957, and on July 1, 1994, the name was officially changed to the University of Memphis.Governing BodyThe governance and control of the University of Memphis is vested in the Tennessee Board of Regents. The composition and powers of the Board are set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated 49-8-201 through 49-8-203. The Board consists of 18 members; 12 lay citizens appointed for six- year terms by the Governor from each congressional district and grand division of the State; one faculty member appointed for a one-year term; one student appointed for a one-year term by the Governor from among the System institution; and four ex officio members--the Governor, Commissioner of Education, Commissioner of Agriculture, and the Executive Director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.OrganizationThe schools and colleges that make up the University are the Graduate School, the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, the University College, the Loewenberg School of Nursing, the School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, and five colleges offering graduate and undergraduate programs: the College of Arts and Sciences, the Fogelman College of Business and Economics, the College of Communication and Fine Arts, the College of Education, and the Herff College of Engineering. The institution also offers a University Honors Program for highly motivated students seeking exceptional and challenging programs of study in a variety of disciplines. The colleges, departments, and the undergraduate degree programs they offer are described in more detail in the Colleges and Degree Programs section of this Catalog.Text Only | Print | Got a Question?

A final transcript of all high school credits: Early decisions can be made by submitting partial transcripts (6th or 7th semester).

Any additional items and information requested in the application materials by the Office of Admissions.Student success at the University of Memphis is strongly predicted by academic performance in high school and also linked to performance on the ACT. Therefore, an Admissions Index will be calculated for each applicant by first multiplying the cumulative high school GPA by 30 and then adding the ACT composite score. The admission of first-time freshmen is selective based on the calculated index, and also includes an evaluation of the required high school curriculum completed. In some cases, recommendations are also considered.Applicants who wish to provide additional information regarding special talents or circumstances may do so by contacting the Office of Admissions. Applicants with diagnosed learning disabilities should contact the Director of the Office for Students with Disabilities for further information.High School Curriculum Required For AdmissionNo high school curriculum can assure that a given student will acquire desired learning outcomes; however, the absence of certain components greatly increases the likelihood that the student will not acquire those outcomes and reduces the likelihood that the student will enjoy maximum benefits of a college experience. The justification for colleges' recommending or requiring specific high school units for admission is to reduce the likelihood that a student will be unprepared for effective work in college and to increase maximum benefits a student may enjoy. (3 of 12) [12/31/2008 2:39:08 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Admissions :: University of MemphisEffective the Fall Semester 1989, among the units required for graduation, the following specific high school units must be included in the minimum admissions requirements at all Tennessee State Board of Regents universities and colleges.Students who do not take one or more of these required courses, where they are available, may not be eligible for admission to the University.English (4 units required): Units in this category must address reading and literature, writing, speaking and listening, and principles concerning the English language. Extensive experience in reading and writing should characterize all courses.Visual And/Or Performing Arts (l unit required): Units in this category should include a survey of the arts (visual arts, theater, music, and dance) or active participation in one or more of the arts.Mathematics (3 units required): Units in this category must include Algebra I, Algebra II, and geometry or an advanced course with geometry as a major component. Students are recommended to take a fourth unit in computing, advanced mathematics, or statistics. All college freshmen will benefit by having studied mathematics as seniors.Natural And Physical Sciences (2 units required): Units in this category must include mathematical skills, fundamental concepts, and some laboratory and field work. At least one unit must address detailed knowledge in the more traditional fields of biology, chemistry, or physics and must include a laboratory.Social Studies (2 units required): For students graduating prior to spring 1993, the units in this category may include: history, government, geography, economics, sociology, psychology, or anthropology. For students graduating in the spring 1993 or thereafter, these units must come from the following: modern history, ancient history, world history, world geography, or European history. One unit in American History is also required.Foreign Language (2 units required): Two units in a single foreign language are required in this category.These stipulated high school units are not intended to specify what the total high school curriculum should be. Secondary schools seek to meet the needs of various student clienteles, one of which is the college-bound student. The stipulations are, on the other hand, an attempt to make a strategic application of academic competencies. They reflect the bridge from specific desired learning outcomes to a list of required college admission criteria. That list is composed of high school units presumed most likely to result in the required learning outcomes. For the sake of clarity, one unit constitutes one year of high school study of a given subject.Applicants with subject deficiencies may, with proper institutional approvals, be admitted to the university; however, the deficiencies must be removed during the first 64 semester hours (30 semester hours for transfer students) of college enrollment.

A semester hour is defined as the credit earned for the successful completion of one hour per week in class for one semester; or two to three hours per week of laboratory for one semester. (A course which gives three semester hours credit will normally meet for three lecture or recitation hours per week, or for two lecture or recitation hours and two-three laboratory hours per week; or for some other combination of these.) Each lecture hour presupposes a minimum of two hours preparation on the part of the student.Class Attendance Classification of Students Maximum Credit Hour Load Academic Standards Undergraduate Grade Appeal Procedures Computing GPA Academic Fresh Start Academic Status and Retention Recognition of Academic Performance Privacy Rights of Parents and Students Credit Transferred from Other Institutions Additional Means of Earning (1 of 2) [12/31/2008 2:40:48 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Classification of Students :: University of MemphisThe minimum credit hour load for classification as a full-time student is 12 credit hours for a term (all sessions combined for fall, spring, or summer). The maximum loads are found on the maximum credit load page by clicking here. The maximum credit hour load includes all course enrollments for any term, both at the University of Memphis and any concurrent enrollment at other institutions. It does not include credit by examination. No student is permitted to enroll for correspondence or extension courses while carrying a maximum credit hour load.Text Only | Print | Got a Question?

The grade of a student in any course is determined by class standing and examination, combined in such proportion as the instructor in charge of the course may decide. The instructors grading scale will be provided to students on the course syllabus.The instructors evaluation of the students work is expressed by the following grades which are converted to quality points for the purpose of averaging grades.GradeQuality PointsA+4.00A4.00A-3.84B+3.33B3.00B-2.67C+2.33C2.00C-1.67D+1.33D1.00F0.00W (Withdrew)0.00Class Attendance Classification of Students Maximum Credit Hour Load Academic Standards Undergraduate Grade Appeal Procedures Computing GPA Academic Fresh Start Academic Status and Retention Recognition of Academic Performance Privacy Rights of Parents and Students Credit Transferred from Other Institutions Additional Means of Earning (1 of 5) [12/31/2008 2:40:50 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Academic Standards :: University of MemphisI (Incomplete)0.00NR, None Reported0.00NC, Non Credit0.00*IP, In Progress0.00*S, Satisfactory0.00*U, Unsatisfactory0.00T (see below)0.00AD, Audit0.00CR, Credit0.00*Grades used to postpone or suspend course completion include I (Incomplete), IP (In Progress), and W (Withdrawn).Independent studies courses, student teaching, workshops, practical, and internships should be graded A-F, IP or S/U, IP. A grade of S, U, or IP does not carry any quality points and is not included in computing GPA. All courses for which the student is registered are recorded as passed (with a letter grade), T, failed, dropped, withdrew, audit, credit, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or incomplete. In no case is credit allowed in any course for which the student is not properly registered.Grade of Incomplete: The grade of "I" (Incomplete) may be assigned by the faculty member in any course in which the student is unable to complete the work due to extraordinary events beyond the students control that are acceptable to the faculty member. The I may not be used to extend the term for students who complete the course with an unsatisfactory grade. Unless the student completes the requirements for removal of "I" within 45 days from the end of the semester or summer term in which it was received (see University Calendar), the "I" will be changed to "F," whether or not the student is enrolled. The faculty member may grant up to a 45-day extension if sufficient extenuating circumstances exist. At the end of the extension period, the I will automatically revert to F if the student has not completed the requirements. The student will be certified for graduation only when all requirements are met, including the removal of I grades. For students who have an I in a course required to fulfill degree requirements in the semester in which they expect to graduate, the certification process and graduation will automatically be deferred to the next term.In Progress: In courses with In Progress (IP) grading, faculty members may assign IP to extend the time permitted for completion of research or course requirements. A student awarded an IP grade must re-enroll in the course for the same number of hours to complete the work. The final grade will be submitted by the faculty member at the end of the term in which the work is completed. This should be the semester following the IP grade.Grade Changes: Grades properly issued in a course by the faculty member of record will not be (2 of 5) [12/31/2008 2:40:50 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Academic Standards :: University of Memphisaltered except when an error was made in computation or reporting or as a result of a formal grade appeal. A grade other than "I" or "IP" may not be changed as a result of additional work after a grade has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar. The Grade Appeals procedure is described below.T" Grade: The "T" grade allows students to complete independent studies courses in variable time periods that might exceed a regular enrollment period. The following procedure governs the use of the "T" grade:1. Prior to the registration period, the faculty member obtains approval of the department chair and dean to use the "T" grade in a course(s).2. The dean notifies the Office of the Registrar of courses for which the "T" grade may be awarded.3. At the end of the regular term, the faculty member has the following options: a. Award grades A-F. b. Award an "I" grade if the faculty member feels that the work can be completed in 45 days. (If an "I" grade is awarded, a roster with the student's name on it will be sent to the faculty member during the 45-day period. The faculty member must record either A to F for the "T" grade to prevent an automatic assignment of "F.") c. Award a "T" grade. If the "T" grade is awarded, the student must re-register for the course in order to earn credit. The "T" grade is not used in the computation of GPA.Grade ReportsCurrent semester grades may be obtained on Student Self Service at . Grades are normally available by the Thursday after the last day of the exam period for the session.Withholding of Grade ReportsThe University is required by State law to withhold grade reports, transcripts and diplomas from students who have outstanding financial obligations to the University. When financial obligations have been resolved, students may obtain their grades on Student Self Service at http:// spectrum.memphis.eduRepetition of CoursesA student may repeat most courses in an attempt to improve the grade previously earned. There are some courses that may not be repeated for this purpose. Information concerning these courses may be obtained from the office of the chair of the department in which the course is (3 of 5) [12/31/2008 2:40:50 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Academic Standards :: University of Memphisoffered. In some degree and major programs, there are restrictions on course repetitions even after drops or withdrawals. The student should always check with the major advisor before enrolling in a course a second or subsequent time(s).The University is not obligated to allow substitutes for repetition of courses, which have been deleted from the curriculum. Credit by examination may not be used for the purpose of improving a grade previously earned in a course taken for credit.Grades earned in the second and each subsequent attempt will count towards the student's GPA. A student may not attempt the same course more than three times. Exceptions to this policy will be granted only on appeal to the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs.The record will continue to reflect all grades earned in the same course.Audit CoursesStudents who are admitted to the University of Memphis may register to audit a course with the prior approval of the instructor and the department chair. Students enrolling on an audit basis do not receive academic credit for that course. Particularly in high-demand courses, departments should make sure that students who need these courses for degree credit can be accommodated before they issue permits for audits. Audits should not be used simply as a vehicle for obtaining access to laboratory or studio facilities.Auditors are not required take examinations and do not receive a regular letter grade. There should be a precise agreement between the student and the instructor as to the extent and nature of the student participation in the course, including class discussions, projects, and readings. Students auditing a course will receive AD (Audit) on the transcript only if they have attended regularly and participated according to the prior agreement with the instructor.A student may not change from a grade point to an audit or from an audit to a grade point basis after the last day to add classes for that session. Any questions concerning this policy should be referred to the colleges.Fees for audits will be assessed on the same basis as fees for credit courses.Credit/No-Credit CoursesThe University, wishing to encourage students to broaden their range of interest without jeopardizing their grades, allows students who have earned at least 60 semester hours with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 to enroll in credit/no-credit courses. For this purpose, students may take up to 8 hours of coursework on a credit/no credit basis provided that these courses are unrestricted electives. Specifically excluded are general education, college, major and degree requirements and requirements for a minor. A student taking a course on a credit/ no-credit basis must meet the prerequisites for that course as set forth in the Catalog, or have (4 of 5) [12/31/2008 2:40:50 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Academic Standards :: University of Memphispermission of the instructor. Neither a credit nor a no-credit grade is counted in a student's grade point average, but, like all other grades, is entered on the permanent record. Credit (CR) grade is given for C- or better work on the traditional grading scale and no-credit (NC) is given for less than C- work. The student only receives credit in the course if credit (C- or better) is received. A student may not repeat a course for credit/no-credit if the student received a conventional grade (A-F or S).Students who transfer from one college to another should be aware that credit/no-credit hours may be accepted in one college and not in another. In every instance, approval to register for a course on a credit/no-credit basis must be obtained from the advisor and the dean of the student's degree-granting college prior to registration for that class.With approval, a student who registers for a course on a credit/no-credit basis may change the registration to a letter grade point basis only during the add period, and a student who registers for a course on a letter grade point basis may change the registration to a credit/no-credit basis only during the add period for the term or session of the course. The student who successfully completes a credit/no-credit course will receive the appropriate number of hours as credit toward graduation. These hours will not be used in the computation of the grade point average.Text Only | Print | Got a Question?

The purpose of the grade appeal procedure is to provide a review process 1) for a student to understand the reasons why the grade was assigned, 2) for the instructor to become aware of and correct possible errors, 3) for appropriate supervisors at the department and college level to review the basis on which a grade has been awarded and to correct cases in which a grade is determined to have been assigned based on arbitrary or capricious action, or other reasons not related to academic performance. If, after departmental and college review, the grade is still in dispute, an appeal may be submitted to the Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee, which consists of faculty and student representatives, for final resolution.In all cases of a disputed grade, the student has burden of proof that the grade assigned was not appropriate. If the case has not been resolved at the student/instructor level, then the student should submit a written petition that would include a copy of the syllabus along with copies of any tests, quizzes, assignments or other written work completed and graded as part of the class requirements to the appropriate step of review. At each step of further review, copies of any previously submitted materials and any written responses to those petitions should be included.It is important to distinguish grounds for grade appeal from questions about quality of instruction. Successful grade appeals should be based on evidence that the student performed at a level sufficient to warrant a different grade. It is important for students to bring to the instructors and the departments attention perceived deficiencies in instruction, but these by themselves do not normally warrant a change in grade. For a successful grade appeal, the student should be able to show, for example, not that the student could have earned a grade of B under different circumstances, but rather that the student actually did earn a grade of B according the standards set out on the syllabus for that course, but was assigned a lower grade. If, in the opinion, of the department or the college, deficiencies in instruction are so grave as to warrant an alternative accommodation, then the proper remedy will normally involve alternative assignments or examinations to allow the student the opportunity to demonstrate the appropriate level of competency in that area to earn a different grade than the grade Class Attendance Classification of Students Maximum Credit Hour Load Academic Standards Undergraduate Grade Appeal Procedures Computing GPA Academic Fresh Start Academic Status and Retention Recognition of Academic Performance Privacy Rights of Parents and Students Credit Transferred from Other Institutions Additional Means of Earning (1 of 4) [12/31/2008 2:40:52 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Undergraduate Grade Appeal Procedure :: University of Memphisoriginally assigned. The decision about these cases should be made at the departmental or college level. In disputed cases where the appeal is based primarily upon perceived quality of instruction, the Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee has the option of referring the case directly to the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs.ProceduresA student wishing to appeal a grade must follow Steps 1-4 listed below. (The deadlines listed below apply to the dates when classes are in session during the fall or spring semesters.) If a student fails to observe the deadlines, the decision made in the previous step will be final. If a department or college fails to respond to the students complaint within the deadline, the student should contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs. The deadline for filing the appeal should be extended appropriately to ensure that the student retains the opportunity to pursue the appeal at the next step. All correspondence and records will be retained in the office in which the complaint is resolved.Step 1: The student should first consult with the instructor, at the latest within two weeks of the beginning of the subsequent fall or spring semester, in an effort to provide a satisfactory resolution of the complaint. If the student cannot schedule a meeting with the instructor, the student may contact the department chair, who will schedule the meeting between the student and the instructor. The only exception to this step is the case in which the instructor is unavailable. In this case, the student may proceed directly to Step 2.Step 2: If the complaint is not resolved in Step 1, the student may present the complaint in writing by the end of the third week in the semester to the chair of the department in which the course was offered. Included in the petition the student should attach the appropriate materials described above, and if available, the instructors written explanation for the assigned grade. The department chair will attempt to resolve the complaint in consultation with the instructor and the student. The department chair will provide a written response to the student within two weeks from the time the written complaint has been received. If the department chair was the instructor of the course, the student may proceed directly to Step 3.Step 3: If the complaint has not been resolved at the departmental level, the student may appeal further by presenting a written petition to the dean of the college in which the course was offered, along with a copy of the materials presented at the previous stage and any written responses received from the department. At the latest, this petition should be presented within one week after the departmental response. Within two weeks of the time the complaint was received, the dean may use any resources available to resolve the conflict.If the dean finds that the request does not have merit, the dean shall notify the student in writing, with copies sent to the instructor and the department chair. If the dean and the department chair agree that the grade should be changed, the dean shall be empowered to change the grade without the instructors consent. Either the student or the instructor may appeal this decision in Step 4. If the dean and the department chair do not agree, the dean shall present his or her view in writing to the student, with copies to the instructor and the department chair, so that the student may include that information in an appeal to the (2 of 4) [12/31/2008 2:40:52 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Undergraduate Grade Appeal Procedure :: University of MemphisUndergraduate Grade Appeals Committee for final resolution of the complaint.Step 4: If the complaint has not been resolved through the previous steps, the student may present a grade appeal petition addressed directly to the Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee through the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs. Copies of written materials and petitions presented at the previous steps, along with any written responses received from the department or the college, must be included with the petition at the time of submission. The deadline for submission of a petition is March 15 for grades awarded during the previous fall term, and October 15 for grades awarded during the previous spring or summer terms. The Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs will forward the petition along with the attached materials to the chair of the Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee, who will distribute copies to the members of the Committee.The Committee members shall review the petition and the attached materials and then forward their recommendation to the chair of the Committee about whether a hearing is warranted in this case. If a majority of the Committee does not vote that the case merits a hearing, the grade stands as issued. If a majority of the Committee votes in favor of a hearing, the chair of the Committee shall inform the student and the instructor, and shall arrange a hearing to be attended by the student, the instructor, and the members of the Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee or their designated alternates. Copies of the Committees decision for the hearing shall be sent to the department chair and dean of the college.Prior to the hearing, the instructor should be given a copy of the students petition and supporting materials. If members of the Committee feel that additional factual information is needed prior to or after the hearing to render a decision, the chair of the Committee should inform the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs of that request in writing, and that office should make every effort to provide that information in writing to the Committee. At the hearing, first the student and then the instructor will each have the opportunity to present their cases orally and to present any other written materials they deem appropriate. The Committee members shall have the opportunity to ask questions to both the student and instructor. At the end of the meeting, the student and then the instructor shall be given the opportunity for brief closing statements.The chair of the Committee should inform the student, the instructor, the department chair, the college, and the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs of the Committees decision in writing within one week of the hearing. If a majority of the Committee agrees that the grade should be changed, the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs will notify Student Records of the grade change. Otherwise the grade shall remain as recorded. The decision of the Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee shall be final.The Undergraduate Grade Appeals Committee shall be composed of seven members and seven alternates constituted as follows:A chair designated by the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs, a faculty member and alternate designated by the dean of the college involved, two faculty members and two alternates designated by the Faculty Senate, one student and one alternate designated by the (3 of 4) [12/31/2008 2:40:52 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Undergraduate Grade Appeal Procedure :: University of Memphiscollege, two students and two alternates selected through the Student Government Association.Although the primary responsibility of the Committee is to review grade appeals and assign the appropriate grade in cases where the appeal is upheld, the Committee shall also report any findings of discrimination or prejudice to the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs for further consideration and possible action.Text Only | Print | Got a Question?

It allows for the calculation of the applicant's grade point average and credit hours toward graduation to be based only on work done after returning to college. Preliminary information and application forms may be obtained from the Office Academic Status and Retention . Requirements to be satisfied by a student requesting an Academic Fresh Start toward a baccalaureate degree are as follow: Separation from all academic institutions for at least four years. Formal application must be made prior to completion of 24 semester hours of earned graded course work following the readmission or admission to the University of Memphis. Developmental studies courses (DSP) will not count toward the 24 semester hours of earned course work. The applicant must complete at least 6 semester hours of earned graded course work within one semester. Only courses for degree credit may be counted. At the time of application for ACADEMIC FRESH START, the student must have a GPA of at least 2.50 for all work attempted after returning to college. Formal application describing the academic degree plan must be submitted to the Office of Academic Status and Retention Services. After the academic plan is reviewed, the Office of Academic Status and Retention Services will forward the plan to the appropriate college dean for approval.Upon approval of the college dean, the student will be granted an Academic Fresh Start. It may be granted once. The students permanent record will remain a record of all work; however, the student will forfeit the use for degree purposes at the University of Memphis, any college or University credit earned prior to the four-year separation indicated above. The date of the fresh start will coincide with the date of re-entry following prolonged separation, and the permanent record will note that a fresh start was made and the date of the fresh start. The record will also carry the notation, GPA and credit totals are based only on work beginning with that date.

KURTZ, Ph.D., Dean Room 107, Scates Hall (901)678-3067 PURPOSES The College of Arts and Sciences has three distinct functions within the framework of the University.1) Its primary function is to offer a strong liberal arts program designed to help the students prepare themselves for life in their own cultural setting by acquiring the means and desire to continue the processes of intellectual development and character formation throughout their lives. "The purpose of education," wrote John Stuart Mill, "is to make capable and cultivated human beings." "Education has for its object the formation of character," wrote Herbert Spencer. We believe that people are people, no matter what their careers, and that if we can help people to become more capable and sensible, they will have better careers and lives. It is our belief that the best preparation for any profession or vocation is a thorough foundation in those major fields of human interest, which are included in the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. A program of liberal studies at the University of Memphis aims to provide the students with a store of factual knowledge, to introduce them to varying sets of principles, to stimulate them to think about and evaluate facts and principles, and to encourage them to order their own affairs and those of their society with the talent, insight, and discrimination they develop.2) The College of Arts and Sciences offers this kind of education to the candidates for its own degrees, and to the students of other colleges of the University, all of whose degree plans call for courses in the arts and sciences.3) The college offers preparatory courses for students interested in careers in medicine, Organization of the College Academic Programs College and Degree Requirements Academic Advising Residence Requirements Pre-Professional Training Departmental Requirements for Majors and minorsList of ProgramsAfrican and African American Studies Anthropology Asian Studies Minor Biology Chemistry Computer Science Criminology and Criminal Justice Geography Earth Sciences Economics English Environmental Studies Minor Foreign Languages History International Studies (1 of 3) [12/31/2008 2:42:20 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: The College of Arts and Sciences :: University of Memphisdentistry, nursing, teaching, law and other professions; specific pre-professional programs, designed to prepare students to qualify for admission to professional schools, are available.Organization of the CollegeAcademic ProgramsCollege and Degree RequirementsAcademic Advising Residence RequirementsPre-Professional TrainingDepartmental Requirements for Majors and minors List of ProgramsAfrican and African American StudiesAnthropology Biology Chemistry Computer Science Criminology and Criminal Justice Geography Earth Sciences Economics EnglishBornblum Judaic Studies Legal Thought and Liberal Arts Minor Mathematical Sciences Philosophy Physics Political Science Psychology Public Administration Minor Social Work Sociology Women's and Gender Studies Minor Aerospace Studies Minor Military Science Minor Naval Science (2 of 3) [12/31/2008 2:42:20 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: The College of Arts and Sciences :: University of MemphisEnvironmental StudiesForeign Languages History International Studies Bornblum Judaic Studies Legal Thought and Liberal Arts Mathematical Sciences Philosophy Physics Political Science Psychology Public Administration Social Work Sociology Women's and Gender Studies Aerospace Studies Military Science Naval ScienceText Only | Print | Got a Question?

We seek to develop not only a knowledge of the past, but also an appreciation of history as an intellectual discipline that employs a wide variety of scholarly methodologies in its effort to understand that past. Students are taught to think and work as historians: to read critically and analytically both primary and secondary sources, to appreciate the complexity of historical issues and multiplicity of historical views, and to investigate a historical question or problem and communicate the results of that investigation. Through this broad preparation, history majors acquire essential knowledge and critical skills, which provide valuable assets for a wide spectrum of professions and occupations as well as the fundamental basis for advanced study. Program objectives for a B.A. in History are: (a) to have a fundamental knowledge of the past; (b) to have the ability to think historically: to comprehend continuity and change over time and to understand events and ideas in terms of the variety of contexts giving those events and ideas meaning and significance; (c) to possess the ability to locate appropriate primary and secondary sources, assess those sources in a critical and analytical way, and use them to construct a coherent historical argument; to express a high degree of satisfaction with the quality of the education received in that program.All candidates for graduation at the University of Memphis are required to complete History 2010 or 2020.History Major (B.A.)A.

To be useful that information must be understandable, timely, thorough, focused on the decision at hand, and in the hands of the appropriate individual. Accomplishing all this is the challenge of Management Information Systems. It requires a knowledge of individual and/or group behavior, the process of perception (how people select and interpret information), the decision tools they need, computers and communication technology, systems design, managing data, and the impact individual decisions have on the organization.Program objectives for a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems are: (a) to obtain knowledge of the cultural, global, and ethical environment of business; (b) to appreciate the impact of business decisions on society; (c) to understand the role of information technology and proficiency in relevant computer applications; (d) to possess the ability to integrate knowledge from different disciplines to define problems and research solutions; (e) to possess critical thinking and decision-making skills essential to solving business problems; (f) to obtain effective oral and written communication skills; (g) the ability to contribute effectively within a team environment and the foundation knowledge in each functional area of business; (h) to acquire the knowledge and skills required to organize and deliver information for effective management decision making.Management Information Systems includes several specialized areas including Expert Systems, Telecommunications, Information Systems, Management and Planning, Statistics, System Development, Data Base Management, and general applications of computers to business.Many Management Information Systems courses require substantial hands-on experience in computer labs.

RANTA, Ph.D., Dean Room 232, Communication Fine Arts Building (901) 678-2350 The College of Communication and Fine Arts has four primary functions. First, it offers courses of study aimed at preparing its students to work toward careers in the fine or applied arts, communications, or the performing arts, whether as practitioners, teachers, artists, or consultants. Second, the college affords broad exposure and instruction in fine arts and communication to students of other colleges in the university whose degree programs may be enhanced by such exposure. Third, with a view toward individual professional growth as well as general cultural enhancement, the college vigorously promotes both scholarly research and artistic production on the part of its faculty. Finally, the college seeks to enrich the cultural atmosphere of both the university and the community at large through a continuing variety of public programs, to include art exhibitions, media presentations, dramatic productions, concerts, recitals, lectures, seminars, debates, workshops, festivals, and the like.Through the diversity of these constituent elements, the college reflects the unity and challenge facing the communicative artist and scholar. Ultimately it is our goal to foster a more intense and profound awareness of the broad range of human experience from which the college derives its pertinence and vitality.PhilosophyOrganizationAcademic ProgramsPhilosophy Organization Academic Programs Degree Requirements Residence Requirements Teacher PreparationDepartmental Requirements for Majors and MinorsArchitecture Art Art History Communication Journalism Music Music Industry (1 of 2) [12/31/2008 2:43:27 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: CCFA :: University of MemphisDegree RequirementsResidence RequirementsTeacher PreparationDepartmental Requirements for Majors and MinorsArchitectureArt Art History Communication Journalism Music Music Industry TheatreText Only | Print | Got a Question?

A Dance minor is offered. Students entering the B.F.A. program will elect one of these two concentrations. The University of Memphis is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Theatre.Admission and Retention Criteria: Admission to the B.F.A. program is by application. To remain in good standing as a major, the student must be evaluated through the audition and interview, or portfolio and interview process. Following their audition and interview, or portfolio and interview, applicants will be notified as to whether they have been accepted into the program, accepted for one more semester on a probationary basis, or advised to pursue another degree.(1) Performance: Retention in the Performance concentration is based on a required audition and interview, typically twice yearly. In addition to the interview, the student is expected to present an audition consisting of a group dance audition, and presentation of a song and two monologues from plays of distinctly different styles or periods. The total time of the song and monologues may not exceed five minutes.(2) Design and Technical Production: Retention in the Design and Technical Production concentration is based on an annual required portfolio review and interview. In addition to the interview, the student is expected to present a portfolio of artistic and production work.

Beyond the audition interview or portfolio review, the student's active participation in the co-curricular activities of the department will be assessed by the theatre and dance faculty. Artistic growth, development of technical facility, and continuing commitment to creative excellence on the part of the student will be evaluated. Permission to continue in the program will be based on this evaluation.Internship (THEA 4541): The intent of this requirement and course is to provide the student experience in a full-time theatre production situation. Off-campus participation (usually following the junior year) is an essential element of the B.F.A. program. Details are to be planned in advance in conference with the student's advisor.Transfer of Credit: In certain cases students may be admitted to an advanced level of the B.F.A. program. Such admission will be based upon a departmental advisor's evaluation of previous course work and theatre experience. Even if admitted to an advanced standing, the student will be required to remedy previous course deficiencies.Advising: Upon application to the B.F.A. program, each student will be assigned a faculty advisor. For this degree, 120 semester hours are required for graduation. A minimum grade of "C" is required in all departmental courses applicable to the major. The student must maintain an overall grade point average of 2.0. A 2.0 cumulative GPA is required for all courses completed in the major.Theatre Major (B.F.A.)A.

The curriculum is designed to prepare graduates for professional practice, and to provide a foundation for lifelong learning as well as professional growth.The course of study begins with a strong foundation in mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering sciences, and culminates in a series of synthesis and design courses. These require the student to apply material learned in foundation courses to practical design problems in various areas. Traditional classroom instruction is supplemented with laboratory experiences in four areas. The laboratory courses are designed to develop the students knowledge base with a hands-on learning experience.The program educational objectives express expectations of the program graduates' abilities within the first few years after successfully completing this comprehensive curriculum. (1) Graduates entering immediately into professional practice upon graduation are capable of performing duties of an entry-level engineering position. (2) Graduates pursuing graduate studies are capable of successfully completing an advanced degree. (3) Graduates recognize the need for and are capable of pursuing life-long learning.The diversity encountered in the profession requires the successful Mechanical Engineer to have technical and non-technical skills. Courses in the humanities and social sciences enhance non- technical skills, and explore the engineers relationship with, and responsibility to, society. Students learn that as professionals, they identify with other engineers, and that the welfare of the public is of prime concern. These non-technical courses allow the student to interact and communicate effectively with a wide variety of individuals. One important supplement to this study is a series of lectures on engineering ethics and professionalism.This well-rounded curriculum equips typical Mechanical Engineering graduates of the University of Memphis with the skills and perspectives required for success in a variety of professional Course DescriptionsCollege of Arts and SciencesAerospace Studies (AERO) African and African American Studies (AAAS) Anthropology (ANTH) Biology (BIOL) Chemistry (CHEM) Computer Science (COMP) Criminology and Criminal Justice (CJUS) Earth Sciences (ESCI) English (ENGL) Health Administration (HADM) History (HIST) Interdisciplinary Studies (INTD) International Studies (INTL) Judaic Studies (JDST) Mathematics (MATH) Military Science (ARMY) Naval Science (NAVY) Philosophy (PHIL) Physics (PHYS) Political Science (POLS) Open Learning Fire Services Program (PADM) Public and Nonprofit Administration (PADM) Psychology (PSYC) Social Work (SWRK) Sociology (SOCI) Statistics (MATH) (1 of 5) [12/31/2008 2:46:12 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: Mechanical Engineering :: University of Memphisroles.

Scheidt School of Music Randal Rushing, M.M.E., Interim Director Room 123B, Music Building music courses are divided into two broad categories: (1) small group or individual lessons in vocal or instrumental performance and (2) musical ensembles.Individual lessons, vocal or instrumental performance are offered as INTRODUCTORY INSTRUCTION, LOWER DIVISION, AND UPPER DIVISION applied music (see explanation below). Individual lessons in vocal or instrumental performance are given by university faculty who are members of the relevant Applied Music Division.All students who wish to enroll in applied vocal or instrumental performance must perform an audition for the members of the appropriate Applied Music Division or for a designate of the appropriate division. Because the number of students who can be accepted is limited, it is advisable that the student audition as early as possible to be assured a place with the requested teacher. Practice facilities are provided without charge, but there are additional fees for the individual lessons (see the explanation below under FEES), and a fee is required for certain practice room keys.Examinations for courses in which the student is to receive credit for applied music in vocal or instrumental performance are called Board Exams. For Board Exams, each student performs musical selections and/or technical exercises of a grade of difficulty appropriate to the level of instruction in which the student is enrolled. The board hearing the exam is made up of the members of the appropriate Applied Music Division (for further information, see the explanation below under EXAMINATIONS).Music majors at the University of Memphis are expected to participate in School of Music ensembles; each degree program has specific or general ensemble requirements (see above under the various degree requirements). Non-music majors enrolled at the University of Memphis as degree-seeking students may audition and, if accepted, enroll for applied instruction where staff time is available. If accepted at the Lower Division or Upper Division level for applied instruction, non-music majors must simultaneously enroll and participate in an ensemble sponsored by the School of Music.Any student enrolled at the University of Memphis may audition for applied jazz lessons as space Course DescriptionsCollege of Arts and SciencesAerospace Studies (AERO) African and African American Studies (AAAS) Anthropology (ANTH) Biology (BIOL) Chemistry (CHEM) Computer Science (COMP) Criminology and Criminal Justice (CJUS) Earth Sciences (ESCI) English (ENGL) Health Administration (HADM) History (HIST) Interdisciplinary Studies (INTD) International Studies (INTL) Judaic Studies (JDST) Mathematics (MATH) Military Science (ARMY) Naval Science (NAVY) Philosophy (PHIL) Physics (PHYS) Political Science (POLS) Open Learning Fire Services Program (PADM) Public and Nonprofit Administration (PADM) Psychology (PSYC) Social Work (SWRK) Sociology (SOCI) Statistics (MATH) Women's Studies (WMST) Foreign Languages and LiteraturesArabic (ARAB) Chinese (CHIN) Classics (CLAS) (1 of 7) [12/31/2008 2:48:21 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: MUAP :: University of Memphispermits.

Auditions are held in the Music Building during the pre-college counseling, advising and registration periods before each semester. Auditions may be scheduled in the Music Office, Room 123, Music Building. Any inquiries concerning credits or course numbers should be directed to the director of the School of Music.CREDITS AND GRADES: Students may register for one or two hours credit per semester and will be assigned to individual lessons, a master class, or a combination of the two, commensurate with their level of performance. Additional credit may be earned at the lower division and upper division level. Students earning more than two credits per semester will be assigned additional practice and will be expected to perform at a higher level than those students registered for fewer credits. Grades are awarded on the same basis and have the same significance as in other subjects.REPETITION OF COURSES: MUAP courses in individual lessons and major group instruction, small ensembles, and large ensembles may be repeated for credit but not for the purpose of improving the grade originally earned.EXAMINATIONS: For an examination in applied music, students will prepare and perform for members of the faculty of the School of Music suitable musical selections and technical exercises of a grade of difficulty appropriate to their standing.

Credit for the course will not be awarded to any student who fails to take the examination.INTRODUCTORY INSTRUCTION: Any student may audition for lessons at the one-hour level except in organ; organ students must have the ability to play the piano before beginning organ instruction. A student may not receive more than four hours credit in any one area of major group instruction. The fee for major group instruction will be the same as for one half-hour lesson per week: $50 per semester.LOWER DIVISION COURSES: Applied music courses in the lower division include the study normally carried out during the freshman and sophomore years. Piano or instrumental students at this level should have had several years of intensive study prior to university entrance so that they have a secure, reliable, and well-grounded technique on the instrument. Organ students may begin at this level provided that they play the piano well and have reasonable ability in sight-reading. Those who do not meet this requirement will register for MUAP 1310. To be admitted to lower division study a student must first pass a qualifying examination.Students who fall short of the requirements for admission to the lower-division courses will be Manufacturing Engineering Technology (METH) Mechanical Engineering (MECH) Technology (TECH) Loewenberg School of NursingNursing (NURS) University CollegeExperiential Learning (UNIV) Family and Consumer Science (CSED) Paralegal Studies (LEGL) University College (UNIV) Independent ProgramsOrientation Program (ACAD) Transitional Academic Studies (DSP) University Honors Program (UNHP) University of Memphis Libraries (LBRY) (4 of 7) [12/31/2008 2:48:21 PM] Undergraduate Catalog :: MUAP :: University of Memphisadvised to register for major group instruction until deficiencies are eliminated. Course numbers will be repeated for each semester of study.UPPER DIVISION COURSES: Promotion to the upper division does not follow automatically after the completion of four semesters of courses in the lower division but is made only on the recommendation of the upper division examining committee; such a recommendation will be made only if the student's proficiency as a performer bears promise of future artistic and professional qualities as a soloist. It is at this level that the student normally begins preparation for a recital.JUNIOR RECITAL, ARTIST RECITAL, and SENIOR PERFORMANCE PROJECT: The Junior Recital is required for the Performance Concentration under the Bachelor of Music in Music degree. The Artist Recital is required for the Performance Concentration and the Sacred Music Concentration. The Senior Performance Project is required under the School of Music Concentration. The Artist Recital and the Senior Performance Project are integration courses for which the student must prepare both a public recital and a paper. To register for the Junior Recital and the Senior Performance Project, students must have successfully completed at least two years of credit in upper division lessons in their applied area. To register for the Artist Recital, students must have successfully completed at least four hours of credit in upper division lessons in their applied area. The Junior Recital must be approved by the appropriate applied music faculty through a hearing. Both the musical and the written portions of the Artist Recital and the Senior Performance Project must be approved by the appointed faculty committee through a reading and a hearing. Upon approval, the student may schedule a date for the public performance and make arrangements for the printing of the program. The public performance must be presented no later than two weeks after the date of the hearing.SMALL, CHAMBER, AND SPECIALIZED ENSEMBLES: Advanced students are encouraged (and for certain degree plans are required) to participate in the following groups. Selection for membership is based on audition; courses may be repeated with the approval of the student's advisor. Three one-hour meetings per week.LARGE MUSICAL ORGANIZATIONSAll music students must take a minimum of eight (8) semesters of ensemble. The exact number of large ensembles and other (or small) ensembles is determined by each division and major concentration. In addition, the designations of which ensembles will satisfy large ensemble requirements are determined by each division. Therefore, it is necessary to consult with your advisor for the specific outline for your applied area and degree program. Transfer students lacking sufficient large ensemble credits should consult with their advisor and/or the department chair to determine a method of rectifying the situation. Ensemble assignments are based on audition and may be repeated. Any exception to this general ensemble assignment policy may be made after a review of petitions by the director, the appropriate ensemble director, and the applied studio teacher.

Sex crimes can be prosecuted even if the victim knew the attacker, the victim did not fight back, the victim had sex with the attacker before being r aped, or the victim was drunk or unconscious. Seek medical attention immediately. Do not shower, change clothes or disturb the scene of the attack. Go to the emergency room or call the Memphis Sexual Assault Resource Center (272 - 2020). Ask a friend to go with you, if possible. Medical personnel will treat the physical consequences of assault, such as injury, infection, disease and pregnancy.

MEDIATION Purpose The mediation process provides an alternative to the formal hearing process. It is intended to allow the two people involved in an alleged sexual assault to discuss their respective understandings of the incident with the assistance of a trained mediator. Mediation is designed to encourage each person to speak directly with the other and to accept personal responsibility where appropriate. Its goal is to facilitate the resolution of the incident to the satisfaction of both persons involved. Filing a Complaint Any student considering herself or himself a victim of sexual assault by an other student at The University of Memphis may choose mediation as one alternative for confronting an alleged perpetrator. Requests for mediation should be filed with the Judicial Officer. Because both parties must voluntarily enter into mediation, the Jud icial Officer will work with both parties to determine their willingness to participate in mediation and to verify that mediation is their choice among the 18 Assignment of a Mediator Once both parties have agreed to mediation, the Judicial Officer will assign an experienced mediator to the case. Either party may challenge the choice of a mediator for cause, and the Judicial Officer may then choose to assign a different mediator. The mediat or will contact both parties to set the date, time, and location of the mediation session(s). The Judicial Officer will assign a mediator within two (2) weeks of the agreement to participate in mediation, and the mediation session(s) should be completed wi thin three (3) weeks of the assignment of the mediator. The Mediation Process The only parties who will be present at the mediation session(s) will be the two (2) persons directly involved in the incident and the mediator. During the mediation process the mediator will: 1 . ask the parties to relate their respective versions of the incident in question, including both factual information and their feelings; 2 . identify key issues that emerge in the first step and make these known to both persons; 3 seek th e agreement of both parties on the issues as they have been identified or as they need to be modified; 4. facilitate discussion between the two parties to consider each issue more completely and generate solutions for each; and 5 . work with both parties to develop a written document that will include a statement of agreement on each issue. Mediation Outcome The statement of agreement shall become a part of the contract that both parties will sign at the completion of the mediation process. Any activity or behavior that either party has agreed to perform following the mediation shall be included in the contract. Any outcome of mediation must be agreed to by both parties. The contract shall be kept on file in the Office of Student Judicial and Ethical Program s. The signed agreement will be forwarded to the Judicial Officer for certification. Once approved, violation of the agreement by either party may result in the imposition of disciplinary sanction(s), including suspension from the University. If either par ty believes that the terms of the agreement have been violated, he or she may advise the Judicial Officer, and the Judicial Officer shall investigate the alleged violation. The student accused of the violation may request a hearing of the alleged violation before the Judicial Officer. If the alleged violation is proved, the Judicial Officer shall impose disciplinary sanction(s) against the violator. Appeal Because participation in the mediation process is entirely voluntary and the final result is a product of mutual agreement, the outcome of mediation, including the terms of the mediation agreement, is not appealable. A finding of a violation of the mediation agreement is appealable to the University Appeals Committee pursuant to the procedure outlin ed in Section VII of the Code of Student Conduct. Alternative Procedures If either party is dissatisfied with the mediation process at any step prior to the signing of a written agreement, that party may request that the mediation process cease. Once the mediation process for a particular incident has been discontinued, it cannot be reinitiated. The sexual assault charge may be pursued by the complainant within the University discipline system as provided for in the Code of Student Conduct. 19 Confidentiali ty In order to promote honest, direct communication between the parties themselves and the mediator, and to facilitate the completion of agreed - upon terms, all information shared in the mediation process must remain confidential. In the event that a hearin g is requested after some part of the mediation process has taken place, information disclosed during the mediation process may be admitted in the The Offic e of Student Judicial and Ethical Programs will maintain copies of the original complaint, the mediation agreement, and any documentation concerning completion of the original complaint, the mediation agreement, and any documentation concerning completion of the agreed - upon activities or behavior. Other records generated during the mediation process will be destroyed.
