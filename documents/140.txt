Class P articipation and Assignments (20 points) Because of the experiential nature of this course, your active participation in exerci ses, debriefings, analyses and discussions is expected and evaluated. The evaluation will be based partially on two short written assignment to be completed after the two designated c lass sessions , and even more so on your actual classroom discussion and participation. I will note the quantity of your discussion and, more importantly , the quality mostly to the extent to which you seem to be paying attention to what's going on in class and trying to think about ideas and relate them to your own ex perience. Please note the following: a. Here's where attendance will be reflected in your grade. b. Talking just to be talking without really relating to the topic at hand counts for nothing. Try to stay on target and involved, while relating discu ssions to materials read. c. Your experiences and ideas may help facilitate learning. Therefore, they are important. d. Questions are important, too. If something is unclear to you, ask about it. Someone else probably is even more confused than you . The only stupid question is the one you fail to ask. e. If you're shy or introverted, here's the time to learn to overcome that tendency. Speaking up gets rewarded here, just as it does in real life, and there's no penalty here for making a mistake. 3 .

The summary should contain a very brief overview (1 to 1½ typed, double spaced pages) of the article and a brief (1/2 to 3/4 page) explanation of how the article relates to you, why you chose this article, or wh y you think it is important. Less than this gets less that full credit. For a book, pick out some key concepts from the book or a section of the book, and relate - 5 - them to your personal experience. These summaries should be only about 2 pages long.

Schein Situational #1 In graduate schools the students must become socialized very quickly as to the norms and values of the doctoral program. This experience relates to my first year of graduate school at LSU when the first year doctoral students were forced to quickly learn the norms and values and to band together in order to survive. Concept #1: O rganization socialization involves the learning of organizationally relevant norms, values, and behavior patterns, such as basic organizational goals, preferred means of attaining goals, members' basic role responsibilities. Learning these norms, values a nd behaviors facilitates the transition into the organization and, ultimately, overall success as an organization member. Experience #1 In my first year of graduate school, I learned some of the important rules and norms very quickly. Once, when I ques tioned the validity of what one stat professor was saying, I got shot down very quickly. I learned that asking "challenging" questions that made the instructor look stupid was taboo. The harsh look and pointedly sarcastic reply I got told me to be carefu l. I also learned quickly that missing our 7.30 a.m. "ProSeminar in Psychology" was taboo as well. The word got around before the class even began (from upper class students) that this class was considered sacred by the professor who taught it, if for no other reason than the fact that he, too, hated to get up that early. Result #1 Fortunately, I learned the pivotal norms fairly quickly and also learned to study hard and pass very difficult essay exams. I survived the first year and was i n the top half of my class. My roommate learned some of the norms but missed out on the one about studying ALTERNATIVE EXAMPLE FROM THAT SAME ARTICLE (YOU MUST USE ONLY ONE PER ARTICLE ) Article Or ganizational Socialization and the Profession of Management Author Edgar Schein Situation #2 After my first year at LSU, I was drafted into the Army. I had to learn a completely different set or norms and values from that learned in my doctoral p rogram. The Army strives to first break you down and separate you from your previous norms of freedom, independence, serf reliance and individualism. Concept #2: Upending experiences of socialization help to "unfreeze" the neophyte from previously acc epted attitudes, norms, and values. They are generally unpleasant experiences that upend one emotionally and, hopefully, lead to greater acceptance of the new norms the organization is promoting. - 9 - Experience #2: When I was drafted into the Army in June 1971, my first experience with basic training came shortly after my arrival at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, at 2.00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. We were told that we could sleep late the following day, since we had gotten in so late. Promptly at 5.30 a.m . the next morning, the barracks doors flew open and a screaming first serg eant started telling us "perverts " that we were "in the Army now" and not back home with our mommies. We proceeded to march to the mess for my first taste of Army cooking and then quickly to the barber to get our heads shaved. It became very clear that whatever the norms and values we had been accustomed to in civilian life were no longer in place here. The good life was over and we were definitely IN THE ARMY NOW !!! Result s #2 I learned very quickly to discard any perceptions I may have had about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the good ole USA. I quickly adopt a new set of norms and values that allowed me to survive the Army. I successfully com pleted my two required years and as soon as I was released I headed back to the cushy life of being a grad student. - 10 - Article: "Barriers and Gateways to Communications" Author: Rogers and Roethlisberger Situation #3 Shortly after class concluded , I received a promotion to a another management position in a slightly different area of my organization. It was a promotion to a collateral area. Concept #3: The communication process is not over until communication completes a full cycle back to t he sender. Feedback is essential to clarify and reinforce the commonality of shared information. It is the link between the receiver and the sender that ensures effective communication. Feedback makes possible a two - way process, reversing the sender and receiver roles so that information can be shared, recycled and fine - tuned to avoid ambiguity. Application #3: On January 18 th , I assumed responsibility for a new organization. While some of the responsibilities had previously existed in another depa rtment and were transferred to me, others were new. In addition, my vision of how these responsibilities fit together was completely different. Over the past month , I have worked to communicate this vision to my team members and, until recently, bel ieved that I had done so successfully. However, one team member sent me a memo recently, which clearly let me know that this individual was not "on - board" with what I believed was "our program". In response, I set up a one - on - one meeting with this indivi dual to address his concerns. After this meeting, I felt that we had had a healthy exchange and was comfortable that he had bought into the team's vision. This was until I received a second memo. This second memo, and the meet ing that followed it w ere a couple weeks ago. During this time, I made a more concerted effort to understand the message that this individual was sending. I made every effort to be empathic to his concerns. Having made an attempt to analyze where the miscommunication may have occurred in the first meeting, I concluded that it could quite possibly have been due to insufficient feedback. Subsequent to the second meeting, I summarized, in writing, our conversation, to ensure that we had both had arrived at the same understa nding. Results #3 Now, three weeks after the second meeting, I am encouraged by the positive changes I have noticed in this individual's attitude and performance. He seems to be much clearer in my expectations of him, and I have a new found understa nding of how he can best fit into the vision of where my new department needs to go. - 11 - Extra Credit Article Summaries Suggested Journals This list is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the journals available.

Your southern region consists of seven districts, all headed by a district sales m anager. All of your districts are performing according to your sales projection levels except District IV (Georgia - Florida) which is run by Kate Oliver. Kate's sales figures are about 10% below the levels of other nearby districts, in spite of the fact t hat her area should be one of the better ones, based on demographic analyses and market tests the company has conducted. Last week you talked to Kate and mentioned the sales figures. She said she was doing the best she could (which she reminded you was exactly what you had asked of her when she took over) and didn't think her performance was all that bad. Still, you feel that she doesn't seem to be putting in the effort necessary to get the job done, even though she's young, aggressive, talks a lot, a nd was a top sales rep before she took over the district just six months ago. You have also talked to several of Kate's eight sales reps, including Terry Sharp, Alonzo Wharton, Kenny Golden and Mike Burrage Although they could not, or would not, give y ou any specific information, they seemed nervous about discussing Kate's performance and that of the district as a whole. Terry alluded to sexual harassment concerns, and mumbled something about women pinching his "buns" at a recent training event. Alonz o kept rambling on about the negative affects of norms involving too much competition within the district. Kenny noted several times that he had invited Kate to attend one of his AA meetings with him, but wouldn't say why? All Mike did was complain ab out the rising cost of table dances and couch dances but wouldn't directly relate them to Kate. They all mentioned Kate's aggressive leadership style but were vague and gave no real details, preferring to give it a little more time before saying what was on their minds. You sensed a possible weakness in the relationship Kate was having with her subordinates. You're concerned that a little more time may be enough to ruin the sales figures for the year and possibly even get you into trouble with the com pany. Therefore, you would like to figure out what's wrong and take some action as soon as possible. Using the effort - performance - reward - satisfaction model discussed in class (as well as any other relevant motivation, communication, leadership , percep tion, conflict, organizational change, appraisal, rewards, socialization, etc. models, theories and concepts) analyze the possible causes of the performance deficiency in Kate and in her sales staff. Also note some of the potential solutions suggested by each particular potential cause ( preferably as you go along). Note as well any potential problem areas or process issues (e.g., perception biases, communication problems) that you would want to be aware of as you go about interacting with Kate and the o thers while making your diagnosis of problems. Also, how would you analyze your own behavior as a leader with respect to your part in this district's weakness. What might you do, based on any models or concepts discussed in class, to improve your perso nal performance in this matter. Next week you are going to Kate's district sales meeting in Orlando to set in on and observe the meeting. District managers meet monthly with their sales reps to discuss issues and disseminate information and you usually visit each on a rotating basis. Fortunately this is the month to attend Kate's meeting (your 'first' time with her "at a meeting" since the first meeting when you appointed her six months ago) and you are looking forward to the opportunity to observe he r meeting behaviors with her eight sales representatives. Based on concepts, models, etc. learned in class, what kinds of things might you be looking for in the "group" meeting. "Since you are short of cash", you have also planned a little golf game w ith Mike Cloutier, Ricks Mason, and Ben Benson, three other of Kate's sales reps. Cloutier, being the feeling type that he is, offered to bring along - 13 - the other sales rep, Lanie Jackson, the company ambulance chaser, Bruce Landau, and the company secretar y, Pete Moss to serve as caddies. He said they were all real "sweeties" and wouldn't mind helping out. He offered to get you Colleen Listengart, company historian, as your caddie, and noted the extra benefit she would offer by carrying her computer along on the golf course and recording everything that was said. You'll be exploring potential problems Kate is having as you play. You're sure at least Ben will talk to you since he talks all the time anyway about everything. You're hoping they all will giv e you some information you can use in your analysis. You're also hoping Ricks even shows up somewhere near on time, a rare occasion, so that they don't refuse to let you play your round of golf. Remember that HFFF's ultimate success and your future wit h the company may rest on how well you handle this problem. Good luck! P. S. References to real persons, alive or "missing", and to traits they may possess are, of course, purely accidental.
