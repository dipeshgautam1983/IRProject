After 36 months of payments, you are disabled when Prudential determines that due to the same sickness or injury: å You are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably òtted by education, training, or experience; and å You are under the regular care of a doctor. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certiòcation does not, in itself, constitute disability. Prudential will assess your ability to work and the extent to which you are able to work by considering the facts and opinions from: å Your doctors; and å Doctors, other medical practitioners, or vocational experts of our choice. When we may require you to be examined by doctors, other medical practitioners, or vocational experts of our choice, Prudential will pay for these examinations. We can require examinations as often as it is reasonable to do so. We may also require you to be interviewed by an authorized Prudential representative. Refusal to be examined or interviewed may result in denial or termination of your claim. Pre-Existing Condition Limitation: A disability due to a pre-existing condition that begins within the òrst 365 days of the effective date of coverage is excluded from coverage. A pre-existing condition is an injury or sickness for which you received medical treatment, consultation, diagnostic measures, or prescribed drugs or medicines, or followed treatment recommendations during the 180 days prior to your effective date of coverage. Pre-Disability Earnings: Means your monthly rate of basic earnings, which is 1/12th of your regular annual rate of pay in effect on the day before you become insured. Your Occupation: Means your occupation as it is recognized in the general workplace; it doesnôt mean the speciòc job you are performing for a speciòc employer at a speciòc location. Any Occupation: Means an occupation for which you are qualiòed by education, training, or experience. Beneòt Cost: The cost of your LTD coverage depends on your pay and your age.
