Non-biological samples may or may not require technician time for preparation. 3 Consumables are charged at cost and this cost varies depending on the number of samples processed. Processing biological samples for TEM is labor intensive and project cost is therefore determined by technician time. A typical project may require anywhere between 10 to 20 hours of technician time depending on the number of samples and how difficult they are to section. Turn Around Time For routine histology and transmission electron microscopy sample processing, turn around time is dependent on the workload, service requested and request volume, but we strive for 3-7 working days turn around time. Quotation If needed, the lab manager will provide a quotation after discussing the project scope with the user. The quotation will be based on current IMC fee schedule. Submission of Specimen All work orders should be submitted with appropriately completed request form to help ensure efficient operations and to provide for an organized and traceable workflow. To obtain a copy of the request form please contact the technician in charge. Billing Provision of account number to be billed is requisite for processing of work orders. Invoices will be sent out and account will be billed directly upon completion of service.
