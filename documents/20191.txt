Kiel's research project is titled "Comparative Analysis of Educational Remedies in Destratifying Societies." The fellowship will allow him to expand his research on American educational law and disparities in the South African context. His research will involve comparing the post-apartheid South African experience confronting educational inequities with the decades-long experience following the Brown v. Board of Education decision in the United States. The similarity to Memphis, given local demographics and persistent racial issues, made the choice of South Africa a particularly compelling choice for Kiel. Kiel is one of approximately 1,100 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel abroad through the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program in 2015-2016. The program is administered by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars, a division of the Institute of International Education. The Fulbright Program is the flagship of the international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government and is designed to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. The primary source of funding for the Fulbright Program is an annual appropriation made by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations and foundations in foreign countries and in the United States also provide direct and indirect support. The program operates in more than 155 countries worldwide. For more information, contact Rebecca Laumann, UofM campus representative, at rlaumann@memphis.edu .
