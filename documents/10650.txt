Office of the President About Mission and Plan Communications Leadership Contact Communications from the President's Office President's Report Home Office of the President Communications Veteran Student Enrollment Dear Campus Community: As you know, the University of Memphis established the Veterans Resource Center in January 2014. Since establishing the Center, the U of M has seen a remarkable 60% increase in veteran student enrollment in on-ground and online classes. You may be interested to know that veterans now represent more than 4% of our total student population. I am pleased to report that the greatest percentage increase in veteran enrollment has occurred at the graduate level, with an increase of 136% from the prior spring semester (53 in 2014, 125 in 2015). Undergraduate veteran enrollment has also made impressive growth, increasing by 51% (249 students) over the prior year. Also noteworthy is the increase in the percentage of veteran students taking only online classes – a 148% increase. Consistent with the changes noted above, we have seen an increase of veteran student enrollment of almost 100% at the Lambuth Campus since the spring of 2014. Overall, 78% of veterans who were enrolled in classes during the spring 2014 semester continued to be enrolled into the spring 2015 semester. We can credit the positive perception of our University, along with the diligence and tireless work of the individuals who work with admissions and the Veterans Resource Center, for much of this change. However, it is the character and personal vision of our veteran students who truly make the difference in their own lives and enrich campus life at the U of M. We are honored to play a role in helping them achieve their academic dreams.
