Student submits a non-refundable evaluation fee equal to one credit hour of experiential learning credit ($75 per credit hour for undergraduate and $100 per credit hour for graduate) . Should the portfolio be judged by the expert reviewer to be worthy of college credit, the evaluation fee will be credited toward the student's remaining balance based on the credit hours granted. 5.

Upon receipt, student will be enrolled into the Experiential Learning Credit modular course to develop the portfolio. 6.

Credit may be awarded based on the faculty assessor's determination that the portfolio provides sufficient evidence that the knowledge and skills a student has acquired outside the classroom are equivalent to what one would acquire in respective coursework. 8. Student is notified of faculty evaluator's decision via email.
