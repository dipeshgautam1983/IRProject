Required Text (distributed prior to beginning of class) Heath, Chip and Heath, Dan. (2010). Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard. 1st edition. New York, NY: Broadway Books. ISBN: 978 -0-385-52875-7. (Note: You will find this book quite engaging to read and I strongly suggest that you read the book prior to your arrival .) Course Description As organizational environments become increasingly dynamic, with technological, economic, political and social, changes occurring at ever faster rates, so the transformation of organizational structures and practices has become the most pervasive issue with which organizational leaders have to contend. Whether it be adopting a new technology, restructuring to improve effic iency, or expanding an operation to a new geographical locale, so being able to cope with, and lead, change efforts has become an ever more important part of the senior managerial role. Consequently, the purpose of this course is to develop your understand ing of strategic organizational change processes. While it is true to say that scholars and practicing managers have spent a great deal of time discussing how change takes place, this has frequently been overlaid with implicit, and often explicit, accounts of organizational transformations taking place in an orderly, linear fashion. These accounts are usually presented as being heavily top -down oriented with the individuals who must enact change, and are most affected by it, being largely omitted. B y contrast, this course will seek to fully expose the messy, non -linear ways in which change usually takes place, and the importance for change managers to understand the contextual imperatives that will play a defining role in the contouring of the change process. With these points in mind, the intent is to cover a broad gamut of issues that are associated with change in order to provide you with a reasonably comprehensive appreciation of what to expect when encountering, or leading, organizational transf ormations. Specifically, the course is broken down as below. Please note that, due to the inherently unstructured nature of change, several of these topics will be visited multiple times as we discuss particular change exemplars. 1 Course Objectives The aim of this course is to provide you with an understanding of some of the major theoretical and practical issues that have shaped our conceptualization of strategic change management. By the end of this course, you should have: • An awareness and unders tanding of different perspectives on how strategic change takes place ; • The tools required to explore, analyze, and critique different approaches to change ; • A practical understanding of how to initiate, implement, and sustain large -scale organizational chan ge; • The opportunity to develop analytical and oral skills commensurate with high -level graduate work. Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree The learning outcomes for the EMBA degree program are located on the following URL: Notice that Goals indicate Learning Outcomes for the degree program. The objectives under each learn ing outcome indicate what must be done to reach the learning outcome. Faculty members in the Fogelman College developed these learning outcomes and periodically assess students to determine the level that the learning outcomes are being met. Course Methodology This is a daily seminar that requires you to arrive to each session prepared to play an active role in learning. One of the challenges – and exciting aspects – of graduate seminars is actively engaging in intellectual discussion that involves b oth challenging and defending particular perspectives. There will be an emphasis on you to instigate discussions, respond to points that are raised, and critique ideas. I expect that you will arrive with reflections on your own org anizational change experiences, as well as a willingness to share your thoughts and opinions. Professor’s Expectations In general, you should assist the instructor in creating a positive, supportive environment for learning. Past experience has proven that the professor as course instructor will serve as only one source of learning. A portion of learning will also derive from in -class discussions, the discussions held in informal conversation and group meetings, as well as from individual contemplation of course readings and projects. To that end, students are expected to: • Attend classes and meetings when scheduled • Arrive to class on time • Keep cell phones, pagers, etc. out of sight and silenced • Refrain from using laptops/tablets for purposes other than taking notes • Participa te in discussions when appropriate • Turn in assignments on their assigned due date • Actively manage university -provided email account • Stay abreast of class announcements by reviewing the syllabus and eCourseware frequently 2 Finally, and most importantly: All participants in the class should be considerate of the other class participants and treat them (as well as their opinions) with respect. The class will operate under the assumption that any and all feedback offered is positive in nature and that the intent ions of the person(s) providing feedback are strictly honorable. Insensitivity in this area will not be tolerated. Student's Expectations Students can expect that the professor will adhere to the same basic expectations that the professor has for students (see above). This includes timely attendance, timely responses to emails (usually within 24 hours), timely assignment feedback (usually before the next similar assignment), and respectful treatment. Assessment Criteria Grading is based on a straight curve, i.e., >90=A, >80=B, etc., although the professor reserves the right to curve the grading in exceptional circumstances. As a rule, “plus -minus” grading will not be used. That said, occasionally, a “+“ or “ -“ grade may be given in order to distinguish perf ormance. Points will be distributed as follows: Deliverable Total Points In-class participation 20 Change project proposal 10 Change presentation 70 Total 100 In-class participation. See the “Pedagogical Approach” discussion above for more information about participation expectations. Change project proposal and presentation. By the end of the residency week, e ach student must identify a key change issue on which they will focus for a 10-minute presentation (plus 5 minutes Q&A ), which will be delivered during an evening class session later in the semester (TBD, but most likely in late October, 201 5). This change proposal must be OK’d by the instructor by submitting a one -page (max) summary by the end of class on day three . The change should be significant enough to allow for sufficient engagement, both with the practical situation and the concepts covered in the class (not all of these need to be identified in the initial summary). The transformation does not need to be su ccessful in outcome. You must analyze and comment on why particular events occurred the way they did (you can use the frameworks from class , but be sure to especially analyze your change using the “Switch” framework ), and what lessons we can learn from you r analyses. For your presentation , you should present a summary of the issue, the analysis using fram eworks , and the key take -away lessons. Your presentation grade will be determined by your adherence to the g uidelines as spelled out in the rubric at the end of th is syllabus . Therefore , I strongly encourage you to review the rubric as you prepare your presentation . This will provide you with structured feedback that should provide a useful foundation for future presentations. Schedule of Activities Please refer to the Course and Assignment Schedule for information on meeting dates, due dates, etc. Final Exam Schedule 3 There will be no final exam for this class. Course Policies Email I will send all official course email correspondence to the students' "@memphis.edu" email account. Therefore, it is the student's responsibility to actively manage this email account. This includes ensuring that email messages are read, and that the mailbox is managed, e.g., no "mailbox is full" issues. It is completely ac ceptable for students to forward their memphis.edu email to another email system they prefer, as long as they check it regularly. Attendance It is recommended that students attend all course meetings. Please inform the professor ahead of time if you are unable to do so. Academic Integrity Please refer to the FCBE website on academic integrity (New Window) for expectations regarding academic integrity. Students are also urg ed to review the University's Office of Student Conduct website to better understand potential consequences of not acting in ways consistent with these expectations. Late Assignments Late assignments are not accepted. Extra Credit There is no extra credit in this course. Please focus your efforts on gaining maximum credit in the assignments offered. Inclement Weather Should weather interfere with the course, the instructor will announce any accommodations that need to be made. Syllabus Changes In rare insta nces, the syllabus may have to be changed. It is more likely that assignment dates may need to change. In either case, the instructor will announce these changes on eCourseware and they will be done in such a way as to not penalize the student, e.g., due d ates will not be moved up, unless sufficient and reasonable notice is given.
