The Methodist Le Bonheur Center for Healthcare Economics August 2015 Health Policy Blog Variations i n Healthcare Charges: Does Anyone Know How Much It Will Cost? I. What is the issue? Recent reports in healthcare journals , cited below, and articles in various lay magazines 1 have focused on the variation s in prices charge d by hospitals and other providers for common medical tests and procedures. These reports have demonstrated the wide and, for some, startling variation s in prices charged for identical or similar services at the national and state level s . Does this variability also exist in Tennessee? Does it exist at the local level in , for e xample, Memphis and Shelby County? And what are the causes of these variations and what is the ir significance to consumers and other healthcare stakeholders ? II. Background Th e recent surge in interest in hospital pricing and price variation s may result from several factors. First, public releases of hospital charge s have expanded , increasing the awareness of variation s in charges among providers . In addition to various state and local reports on charges , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) release d in May 2013 details of the charges and payments for the 100 most common 1 See, for example, O .

Expanded enrollment in high - deductible health plans 3 has made more people responsible for more out - of - pocket costs and has promoted cost - driven choices in selecting healthcare providers. As described by Princeton University . 4 H ealthcare researchers Ge Bai and Gerard Anderson 5 documented the variation in charge - to - cost ratios of hospitals , illustrating the disparities in the relation between hospital charges and Medicare allowable costs across the nation . Their results showed that the charge - to - cost ratios varied from less than 1.0 to over 12 . 0. Among the 50 hospitals with the highest charge - to - cost ratios (ranging from 9.2 to 12.6) , 49 were for - profit facilities and three were in Tennessee . Variations in charges for specific procedure - related hospital admissions have also been repeatedly doc umented. A national study of the cost of percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCIs ) in 86 of the 100 largest metro politan statistical areas (MSAs) conducted by BlueCross Blue Shield showed that charges for this life - saving procedure rang ed from approximately $16,000 (in Birmingham, AL) to over $61,000 (in 2 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data .

For example, a recent survey of 122 outpatient radiology centers in 43 c ities showed that the charges billed for an outpatient non - contrast knee MRI varied from $259 to $2,042. 8 And , most surprisingly , the charges billed for 10 common blood tests in California varied by as much as 1 , 000 percent in 2011; the 5 th to the 95 th percentile range of charges for a complete blood count, the test with the smallest range of charges, was $259 to $2 , 042. 9 Wide variations in charge s also exist within a single healthcare market . For example, the Blue Cross BlueShield study cited above reported that the variation in charges for a PCI within t he Los Angeles/Long Beach market varied by 532 .0 percent . 10 6 The Health of America Report , A Study of Cost Variation for Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (Angioplasties) in the U.S. BlueCross Blue Shield, July 16, 2015.

Hospital Price Variations i n Tennessee Data w e re analyzed from Tennessee Hospitals Charge Reports 2013 compiled by the Tennessee Department of Health. 12 Th e s e data included charges for the 50 most costly diagnostic categories for all Tennessee hospitals with more than a minimum number of reported cases. Cases were classified into one of four clinical severity groups minor, moderate, major, and severe. 13 This risk adjustment sought to group patients with similar clinical needs who m ight be expected to require similar amounts of care. What is the V ariation across Tennessee ? The charges for four common procedures among Tennessee hospitals are shown in Exhibit I. The data presented include the number of hospitals reporting charges for six or more cases and the median, maximum , and minimum charges for patients in the , We selected this category because it may be expected that the variation in clinical care would vary less among h ospitals for the least complex cas es than for more severe cases. 11 The Health of America Report , A Study of Cost Variations for Knee and Hip Replacement Surgeries in the U.S. 12 Tennessee Department of Health, Tennessee Hospital Charge Reports 2013 ( Nashville, TN: Tennessee Department o f Health).

Source: Authors' analysis of Tennessee Hospital Discharge Report 2013. The se data show that, as in the nation as a whole, self - reported hospital charges for common procedures vary widely in Tennessee. The difference between the lowest and the highest median charge ranged from $20,118 for vaginal deliveries (271 .0 % of the med ian charge) to $194,147 for hip replacements (442 .0 % of the median charge). What i s the Variation in Shelby County? Median charges for Shelby County hospitals for each of the same four common procedures are tabulated in Exhibit II u tilizing the hospital identifier codes used by the Tennessee Department of Health . The data include only hospitals with six or more cases assigned to the minor risk category .

These data illustrate that wide variation s in charges exist with in the Shelby County market. Variations (differences between the lowest and highest charges) ranged from $9,922 (112 .0 % of the Tennessee median as shown in Exhibit I) for vaginal deliveries to over $43,000 for cholecystectomies (164 .0 % of the Tennessee median). T he inter - hospital variation s for the other clinical severity groups among Shelby County hospitals for these four procedures were also large . For example, the v ariation s among Shelby County hospitals for PCIs in patients without acute myocardial infarction ranged from $33,488 to $131,715 for the and from $42,974 to $ 1 49,441 for the severity group . Health Policy Blog/Hospital Price Variation 7 Examples of variations within other Tennessee healthcare markets are shown in Exhibit III. These data show that wide variations in charges for similar patients exist in all four major market areas and that the size of the variations differ s widely across region al market s. The interhospital variation in all categories is greatest in Davidson County with, for example, the variation in charges for vaginal delivery being approximately twice as great in Da vidson County as in Hamilton County.

Source: Authors' analysis of Tennessee Hospital Discharge Report 2013. National reports also allow comparison of the variation s within Tennessee markets to those within other parts of the nation. Based on data from the Blue Cross Blue Shield reports cited above, the variations in the four regions included in Exhibit III are moderate. For example, the Nashville (Davidson County) M etropolitan S tatistical A rea that ha s the greatest variation in charges among the four Tennessee regions ranked Health Policy Blog/Hospital Price Variation 8 11 th nationally in the size of the v ariation in charges for PCIs among the 86 regions across t he United States ; Knoxville ranked 37 th , and Memphis ranked 49 th . 14 IV. Why Do Variations Exist? To understand the causes and the significance of the variations in prices and charges , it is necessary to understand the basic determinants of hospital charges and payments. H ospital charges master , 15 a price list developed by each hospital of the charges for each billable service provided by the hospital. The final full - charge bill for a patient is t hen the su m of the charges for all services used by that patient during a hospital stay. Many factors may lead to variations in charge s for services . These include , among others, regional differences in labor costs , and inter - hospital differences in patient characteristics, staffing patterns, infrastructure fixed costs, the number of competing hospitals ( and the resulti ng intensity of market competition ) , an d physician practice patterns. T here is , however, little rel ation between the actual costs to the facility of providing a service and what is charged. In a survey of 238 hospitals, fewer than half of the hospitals used actual cost information in deve loping or updating their charge masters. 16 Several studies have al so shown that patient and population level differences in 14 The Health of Amer ica Report , A Study of Cost Variation for Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (Angioplasties) in the U.S. 15 U .

Tanamor , A Study of Hospital Charge Setting Practices (Falls Church, VA: The Lewin Group, December 2005 ) . Health Policy Blog/Hospital Price Variation 9 characteristics explain only a small portion of the variation in charges. 17 , 18 This is also suggested by the differences in charges for services that would seem to have nearly identical costs at different sites and to not be impacted by patient characteristics. These include, as examples, the wide differences in charges for common and standardized laboratory 19 and imaging 20 tests described earlier. Other fa ctors that impact charges may include the costs of other services that are not directly billable and ar e subsidized by other service s, in addition to the external regulatory and legal constraints facing hospitals and the concern for how hospital pricing behaviors are perceived by the local com munity . Perversely, higher charges may reflect a higher rate of patient complications, with subsequent greater service use and costs. Methodologic issues may also impact the analysis of reported charges including, as examples, the imperfect methods for s everity adjustment of patient populations and variations in coding and in the reporting of char ges by hospitals to the state. V. Do These Variations Matter? In addition to a lack of relationship between what is charged and the cost of providing care, another importan t concept in how hospital serv ic es are priced is that there is little relationship between what is charged and what is paid.

Private insurers negotiate heavy discounts with individual hospitals. These amounts vary from one insurer to another and within a given carrier based on the specific plan in which the patient is enrolled. Thus, t he variation s in charges may lead to little or no variation in payments. For example, information from the C enter for M edicare and Medicaid S ervices (CMS) out complications, charges among Tennessee hospitals varied by $30,281 (from $4 , 537 to $34,918), whereas total payments varied by only $ 2,511 , from $3 , 175 to $5 , 686. 21 It is , therefore , often said that hospital charges and variations are largely irrelevant. What is important to hospitals and to payers, it is argued, is not what is charged but what is paid, and payments may have little direct relationship to what is charged. However, charges are relevant to large groups of patients. Uninsured patients, that is, those without a payer to negotiate discounts on their behalf, may be billed the full charge for services. Indeed, data suggest that hospitals and other providers collect more from the uninsured than they do from third - p arty payers for insured patient s. 22 Many states, including Tennessee, have enacted laws and regulations that limit what a hospital may bill an uninsured patient. Tennessee law prohibits healthcare facilities eds one 21 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , M edicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data .

As deductibles and coinsurance rates have increased, patients have become personally responsible for more out - of - pocket healthcare costs. In a ddition, patients may be subjected to the full costs for out - of - network services . Data compiled by the Government Accountability Office illustrate the impacts of variations in charges on out - of - pocket expenses. For example, in the Indianapolis area , out - of - pocket costs for a n MRI of the lower back at selected acute - care hospit als varied by over 850 .0 percent , from $277 to $2,637 . 25 I n the Denver area, the estimated total out - of - pocket cost of a laparoscopic gallbladder surgery in selected ambulatory s urgery centers varied by over 100 .0 percent , from $3,281 to $6,954. Finally, the full charge may be used by hospitals to report the amount of and the amount of unreimbursed care provided to Medicaid enrollees. A survey by the consulting firm of Pricew aterhouseCoopers (PwC) indicated that three - fourths of hospitals use charges 23 Tennessee Code Title 68, Chapter 11, Part 2, 68 - 11 - 262 - Limit o n Amount o f Charges f or Services t o An Uninsured Patient. 24 R educed t he P rices A ctually P aid by U ninsured Health Affairs 34(1): 64 - 70, 2015. 25 Government Accountability Office , Health Care Transparency.

VI. What Are t he Implications? The public release of hospital charges represents, as described by Uwe Reinhardt, care system. 27 Information previously held as akin to , and especially th e information about the high variation in charges , suggests opportunities for health system change. First, the variations may drive hospitals to review the methods for developin g and reporting charges to improve their accuracy , to promote their competitiv e advantage , and to project a better image to the public in a competitive and increasingly scrutinized market. Second, the finding that some hospitals may provide a service at a substantially lower charge and with equivalent quality than others suggests t hat cost savings are possible (to the extent that the charges reflect actual costs). For example, Crystal Run Healthcare System in New York reduced cost variation (as well as costs) related to practice variation by emphasizing established clinical guideli nes. 28 Acting on these differences will, however, be complex. Hospitals may be high cost for one service but 26 The Price Waterhouse Coopers survey is available at: . 27 The D isruptive I nnovation of P ric e Trans 28 P ractice V ariat Health Affairs Blog , July 23, 2015. Health Policy Blog/Hospital Price Variation 13 lower for another, making isolating the factors driving high charges difficult (although, as suggested by the Shelby County data in Exhibit II, ho spitals with high charges for one service tend to have high charges for others as well). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, revealing charges allows for comparison shopping by patients for lower cost services, especially when combined with comparative data on quality of care. Evidence suggests that making charges available to patients can reduce healthcare costs . For example, a study of claims from 18 self - insured companies demonstrated that patients who sea rched for prices before a test had significa ntly lower claims for lab tests (13.9% lower) and advanced imaging procedures (13.2% lower) than did those who did not search . 29 States 30 as well as individual hospitals 31 have begun to publish their charges, although readily available and understandable data remain difficult to obtain. 32 Without such information that consumers can understand and use , current and proposed efforts to reduce healthcare spending through consume r - directed options are unlikely to succeed. This situation was encapsulated by Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt: 29 C . Whaley , J . Schneider Chafen, S .

Health Policy Blog/Hospital Price Variation 14 In virtually all other areas of commerce, consumers know the price and much about the quality of what they intend to purchase. The information makes comparison shopping relatively easy and is the sine qua non of properly functioning markets. By contrast, consumer - directed health care so far has led the newly minted consumers of US health care (formerly patients) blindfolded into the bewildering US health care ma rketplace . . . . Consequently, the much ballyhooed consumer - directed health care strategy so far has been more a cruel hoax than a smart and ethically defensible health policy. 33 *** End of Blog *** 33 Health C are p rice T ransparency and E conomic T heory JAMA 312(16):1642 - 1643, 2014.
