Ecological Research Center About Facilities People Research Teaching Services Home ERC Training Tomorrow's Ecologists The Ecological Research Center serves as a research and advisory asset to the regional community. Ensuring ecologically sound planning and development within the urban environment is the most vital goal of the Center. The Center assists in the identification of ecologically related problems and avenues for resolution. Programs developed by the Center benefits residents of Memphis, the Mid-South, and the global community by assessing issues that explore and improve the quality of life for every individual. The Center takes a proactive approach to meet community needs while considering the concerns of all stakeholders. The Center's new Urban Ecology Initiative represents an opportunity for the University of Memphis to be a leading force in the Ecological Age, to help establish an ecologically literate workforce, and to develop a new breed of Ecologist who will work in and for the urban environment. In so doing, we can provide a model for others to follow regionally and worldwide. Program in Urban Ecology Learn more about the new frontier in science that focuses on the dynamic interactions among humans and the sustainability of ecological systems and natural resources.
