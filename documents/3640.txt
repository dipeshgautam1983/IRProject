The list honors the top colleges, universities and trade schools that are doing the most to embrace military service members and veterans as students and ensure their success on campus. Among the UofM's military-friendly features are: a Veterans Resource Center, which provides services and support for veterans and military students; a wide range of online courses and degree programs; participation in the Yellow Ribbon Program; seamless transfer of credits from community colleges; and three ROTC programs – Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, the Memphis area is home to Naval Support Activity Mid-South and its strong military community. This summer, the UofM was one of 11 colleges selected to receive the Veteran Reconnect Grant, a competitive grant aimed at improving the success of student veterans enrolled in Tennessee colleges and universities. The $93,274 award will allow the UofM to create a Student Veteran Support Team, support dedicated internships for student veterans, and increase training for faculty and staff on improving services to veterans. "Being recognized as a Military Friendly School is both a great honor and consistent with the ideals and values of the University of Memphis," said President M. David Rudd. "We are pleased to be able to serve those who have served with such courage and dedication." Now in its seventh year, the list of Military Friendly Schools is compiled through extensive research and a data-driven survey of employers, schools, franchise systems and cities nationwide. More information, including a complete list of 2016 Military Friendly Schools, is available at militaryfriendly.com .
