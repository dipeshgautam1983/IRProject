Graduate Catalog Home About Admissions Academic Regulations Faculty and Staff Archive Home Graduate Catalog Academic Regulations Privacy Rights Privacy Rights of Parents and Students The University complies fully with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974. This act is designed to protect the privacy of educational records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review their educational records, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings. Students also have the right to file complaints with the FERPA Office concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the Act. Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school. For additional information, you may call 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327) (voice). Individuals who use TDD may call 1-800-437-0833. Or you may contact us at the following address: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20202-8520 The provisions for the release of information about students and the rights of students and others to have access to the University of Memphis education records are published each semester in the online class listing. A copy of the Act and the University of Memphis Procedure may be reviewed in the offices of the Registrar or University Counsel. Graduate Catalog Learn more about our degree programs.
