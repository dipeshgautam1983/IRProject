Fogelman Professional Development Center and faculty member in the Department of Management at the University of Memphis, was recently recognized in the Memphis Business Journal's "Super Women in Business" list. This year's top 25 list honored women in different industries who have achieved significant success through leadership in business and community contributions. Only two of those selected were from institutions of higher education. The recipients were evaluated on their individual level of community reinvestment in terms of involvement in nonprofit and community organizations. "It's rewarding to see our faculty recognized for their successes in the business community," said Dr. Rajiv Grover, dean of the Fogelman Colleges of Business &amp; Economics. "Furthermore, Dr. Tuberville is an excellent role model for our current students – especially our young women." The annual Super Women in Business awards luncheon was held Aug. 28 at the Hilton of Memphis.
