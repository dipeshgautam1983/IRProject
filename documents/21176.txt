Chemistr y Chemistry today is a large and complex field. Beyond the more traditional sub - disciplines of organic, inorganic, physical , and analytical chemistry, the study of chemistry at the university level will also introduce you to materials science, polymers, biochemistry and molecular biology, biotechnology, environmental chemistry, and pharmaceu tical and medicinal chemistry. At T he University of Memphis, you can choose two degree options in chemistry : a B.S., with a Chemistry Major; or a B.S. Chem. , for those students preparing for careers as professional chemists intending to pursue advanced degrees in Chemistry. The latter meet s the requirements of the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society. A concentration in biochem istry is also an option with both degrees. What does a typical selection of courses look like? After you ha ve complete d introductory courses and labs in general, inorganic , and organic chemistry, you can continue in more advanced work in those areas, and you can also explore topics such as: Quantitative Chemical Analysis , Physical Chemistry , Environmental Chemistry , Computational Chemistry , Organic Medicinal Chemistry , Biochemistry , and Instrumental Methods . What other opportunities can you enjoy as a st udent in Chemistry? Working closely with faculty on research problems of mutual interest Attending weekly departmental lectures by University of Memphis faculty and outside research experts Joining the University of Memphis Student Affiliates chapter of the American Chemical Society, which meets regularly and will help you meet your peers, keep up to date on developments in the field, and learn more about career possibilities after graduation Receiving specialized guidance if you are considering a pre - h ealth field, from the Pre - Health Advisor, Ms. Jessica Kelso , in Scates Hall 107 ( jgcl ffrd@memphis.edu ) , Scholarship opportunities: a number of schol arships are available to students pursuing undergraduate pr ograms in Chemistry CHEMISTRY SAMPLE FOUR - YEAR PLAN [General Concentration] Freshman Year ENGL 1010 3 ENGL 1020 3 CHEM 1110/1111 4 CHEM 1120/1121 4 BS For eign Language 3 MATH - 1920 4 MATH 1910 4 BS Forei gn Language 3 Semester Totals 14 hrs. 14 hrs.
