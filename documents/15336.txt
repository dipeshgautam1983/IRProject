BCP Charge In November 2006 President Shirley C. Raines and the President&rsquo;s Council approved an Avian Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan. Working under the purview of the Crisis Management Team, six committees were established to further develop different components of the plan: 1) Business Continuity; 2) Communication and Education; 3) Safety; 4) Student Life and Residence Halls; 5) Academics and Research; and 6) Health. Background The United States has seen three pandemics of influenza during the past 100 years. Public health authorities are convinced that this cycle of illness will recur in coming years, and are concerned about the possibility that a recurrence may take place in the near future. The possibility of pandemic influenza, affecting community across the world and the United States raises issues of preparedness for the University. Charge These planning groups led by Business Continuity are charged with considering the different scenarios that might arise in the event of pandemic or avian influenza, or other highly contagious and potentially serious infectious illnesses. These groups are asked to consider policies and various actions that might be necessary to respond to such epidemics in order to safeguard the health and safety of our students, staff and faculty, and to secure the academic and business operations of the University. These groups will work collaboratively within the University, utilizing the expertise of academic and administrative departments to develop a comprehensive plan to be presented to the President. The plan should take into account that the University is a major employer and resource within the city of Memphis, Shelby County and the state of Tennessee. The Business Continuity Committee shall prepare a full report for the President and the President&rsquo;s Council no later than June 27, 2007.
