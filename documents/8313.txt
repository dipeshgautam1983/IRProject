Mueller, Ph.D., Program Coordinator Office: 100 Ball Hall Phone: (901) 678-4392 Fax: (901) 678-5114 cemuellr@memphis.edu The Master's of Science (M.S.) program in Educational Psychology and Research provides students with, among other things, three types of experiences: (1) building a solid knowledge base for a wide range of topics in educational psychology and research; (2) developing the basic skills required to conduct research in education-related fields; and (3) getting introduced into the academic and professional community that requires basic research skills. Our program has two concentrations: Educational Psychology and Educational Research. The goal of the program is individualized based on the program requirements and the student’s career goal and academic aspiration. The program monitors the student’s progress through not only the coursework but also the colloquium, research group participation, and annual performance evaluation. Note: The Educational Psychology concentration has a unique online M.S. program approved by the State of Tennessee. It welcomes applicants from across the United States and around the globe. Courses are offered completely online through our course management system, Desire to Learn, are taught by University of Memphis faculty, and include only University of Memphis students. Your transcript will reflect that you successfully completed coursework at the UofM; it does not contain any information about the courses being online.
