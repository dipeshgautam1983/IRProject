Classical Banach space theory developed as an attempt to answer very natural questions on the structure of Banach spaces. Although there has been steady progress in recent years in the various aspects of Banach space theory, many easily stated problems remain open, and others are emerging. I am interested specifically in questions of the following type: given Banach spaces X and Y , when can we say that X is linearly isomorphic to Y , when can we say that X is linearly isomorphic to a subspace of Y , or, more generally, what can we say about the geometric structure of X ? Such questions date back to Banach's book [Ba] in 1932. The solutions of these problems have provided and will continue providing a better understanding of the structure of Banach spaces and produce many applications in other areas of mathematics. Question 1. Does every complemented subspace of a Banach space X with an unconditional basis have an unconditional basis? Can we answer this question for X = L p ? Question 2. Can you characterize Banach spaces which embed isomorphically into a Banach space with an unconditional basis? Question 3. Are l 1 and L 1 the only infinite dimensional complemented subspaces of L 1 ? Question 4. Is every compact operator on a Hilbert space a commutator of two compacts? Question 5. Is every compact operator (on any Banach space) a commutator? If you know the answer for any of these questions, please email me secretly and I will pay you a bottle of hand-made rice wine.
