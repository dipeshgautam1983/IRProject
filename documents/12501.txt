Erin brings more than 10 years of experience in the nonprofit workforce, having served in both development and program management roles, most recently at the Midwest Center for Nonprofit Leadership. Her interest in nonprofit leadership and talent development is carried out through her volunteer involvement as a board member of the National Panhellenic Conference. She was also very involved in the Kansas City community, chairing events for the Humane Society of Greater Kansas City and her neighborhood homes tour; as well as chairing the marketing committees for the Kansas City Blues and Jazz Festival, and the Philanthropy Midwest Conference. Dr. Nelson is excited to continue her community involvement in a new city! Dr. Nelson received both an M.P.A. and Ph.D. in Public Administration from the Bloch School of Management at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, with a research emphasis on the nonprofit sector. Her research interest in the nonprofit workforce, particularly nonprofit career awareness, stems from her own experience as an "accidental nonprofiteer". She is also interested in the impacts of different collegiate experiences on civic engagement during adulthood. It's Time to GO Public!
