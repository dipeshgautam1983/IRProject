The goalofthesummaryanalysisandtheactionplansissimple:TheUoM understands the issuesthat havebeenraisedbyourusercommunity andisproactively working toaddressandresolve these issues. Connectivity &AccessMeasuresservicequalityofnetworkaccess andthe ability toaccessonlineservices (1) Having a campus Internet service that is reliable and that operates consistently across campus. (2) Having a campus Internet service that is fast and that provides speedy access to Web sites and rapid downloads.
