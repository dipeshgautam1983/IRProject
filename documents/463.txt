Take a look inside this issue to find out more about what's going on at Memphis Law and within our community. In this issue, we examine the drone industry and how laws and the legal system are trying to keep pace with the aggressive proliferation of the drone technology. Both the commercial and recreational drone markets are outpacing legislation across the country, and this feature examines how law makers at both the state and federal levels are dealing with the challenges. We also have a second feature about water rights across the nation, and how this hotly contested issue is playing out in our own backyard, with potentially huge ramifications for the region. Don't forget to check out the "Top 10 Lessons Learned in Law School," featuring lessons from 10 of our amazing students, as well as an incredibly informative take on breast cancer awareness as it relates breast density notifications by our own Professor Alena. All of this and MUCH MORE is ready for your reading pleasure in this issue! Click HERE to read the full issue online. Feel free to send us class notes and updates about your accomplishments. Please include your class year and a high-res head shot, if possible. To request a hard copy, please email us and we will send you a copy as long as extras are available.
